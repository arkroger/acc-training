Hello there, it's Yorky and welcome to the channel for the 10th episode of the in-depth

00:10.000 --> 00:13.600
track guide series for a setter coaster competition journey.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.560
And just quickly before we get into all the juicy details that are going to help you improve

00:17.560 --> 00:21.880
your lap times around this circuit, if you're new to the channel and enjoying this in-depth

00:21.880 --> 00:26.360

below.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.800
So for this 10th episode we are going to be taking a look at Barcelona Catalonia in Spain.

00:36.800 --> 00:44.480
The circuit itself comes out to 2.89 miles which is 4.65 kilometers and features 16 turns.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.160
The setup that you want to be using for the circuit should be run about medium downforce

00:48.160 --> 00:52.800
with medium suspension stiffness and then the key action areas where there's possibility

00:52.800 --> 00:59.800
for overtaking will be turns 1, turns 4, 5, 7 and turn 10.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.600
Next up we're going to take a look at the pit entry and the pit exit and the entrance

01:03.600 --> 01:08.080
to the pit lane is just between the penultimate corner and the final corner just before you

01:08.080 --> 01:10.360
turn the car into that turn 16.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.920
It's there on the inside you may need to slow a little bit as you come into the pit

01:13.920 --> 01:19.160
lane and then you will need to slow down and get the car engaged onto the pit limiter.

01:19.160 --> 01:25.080
About 70 or 80 meters before the end of the white concrete wall that's there on the inside

01:25.080 --> 01:29.680
this is where the pit limiter line is actually situated and then at the other end of the

01:29.680 --> 01:34.720
pit lane the pit exit is right next to the Barcelona Martial Hut that you can see situated

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
here.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.440
At this point you want to disengage the pit limiter and accelerate out, down, back, out

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
onto the circuit.

01:40.440 --> 01:45.200
The pit exit line actually extends pretty far down towards turn 1 so make sure you step

01:45.200 --> 01:48.560
to the right of that when coming out of the pit lane.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.800
So we're going to move on to the track itself and we're obviously going to be starting

01:51.800 --> 01:54.280
off with the breaking point for the first corner.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.800
It's about 120 meters before the turn we're going to be breaking hard and shifting down

01:58.800 --> 02:00.320
into second gear.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.000
We're then going to turn the car in towards our first apex aiming to clip the inside

02:04.000 --> 02:06.240
curve which you can use in the dry conditions.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.160
You want to be careful with it in the wet conditions.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.440
The curve as you can see is serrated and there is a slight sloshish curve on the inside

02:13.440 --> 02:15.440
here so you want to be careful of that.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.760
But coming off the exit of turn 1 which you'll want to sacrifice, we're immediately coming

02:19.760 --> 02:21.560
into turn 2.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.600
This is going to be your typical apex point.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.800
Some cars will allow you to use the inside curve but others you'll need to be very cautious

02:27.800 --> 02:32.840
with in both the dry and wet conditions as again quite easily unsettle the car.

02:32.840 --> 02:37.440
But as we come out the exit of turn 2, we don't want to run all the way over to the right

02:37.440 --> 02:41.200
hand side of the circuit where there's that painted tarmac and the astroturfing want

02:41.200 --> 02:47.040
to stay just shy of that to try and open up turn 3 which pretty much immediately follows.

02:47.040 --> 02:51.120
You're going to turn the car in whilst on full throttle and as we come through the corner

02:51.120 --> 02:55.280
you'll need to lift a little bit and close the car through the turn to try and keep it

02:55.280 --> 02:57.360
hooked up towards the inside.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.520
And then as you progress through the turn just off the inside curve as soon as you see

03:01.520 --> 03:06.200
a second set of orange painted tire barriers on the outside that is when you want to be

03:06.200 --> 03:10.000
getting full throttle and accelerating out through the exit.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.520
Right here there is plenty of tarmac to run off onto.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.480
You need to keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits.

03:17.480 --> 03:22.120
You can use this in the dry conditions however you want to be very cautious in the wet

03:22.120 --> 03:25.320
potentially avoid it if entirely possible.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.480
But we're going to stay out here to the left of the circuit ready for the braking zone

03:28.480 --> 03:32.720
of turn 4 which is just before we get to the bridge at the large white line that's just

03:32.720 --> 03:33.760
to the left of the track.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.400
We're going to brake heavily at this point and shift down into first or second gear

03:38.400 --> 03:43.040
aiming for a very early apex where we're going to just brush the curve on the inside

03:43.040 --> 03:47.000
there and run the car a tiny little bit deep and then we're going to try and bring it

03:47.000 --> 03:53.200
back a little bit towards a second later apex as we continue to accelerate and turn through

03:53.200 --> 03:54.600
the corner.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.480
As we're coming off the exit of turn 4 though we don't actually want to run all the

03:58.480 --> 04:01.040
way out towards this exit curving.

04:01.040 --> 04:05.120
You can use it in the dry conditions if you want but you want to avoid it in the wet

04:05.120 --> 04:09.480
conditions as the rumble strip nature of it will cost you the traction but what you want

04:09.480 --> 04:13.480
to do is bring the car immediately back over towards the right hand side of the track ready

04:13.480 --> 04:16.320
to open up turn 5 and this is our braking point.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.880
There's no real reference in and around here so it's pretty much just down to getting

04:20.880 --> 04:25.080
the flow and using your pure judgement for this corner.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.320
So turning in at apex it's actually going to be fairly late in the turn.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.920
You want to get fairly close to the inside curve you can use it in the dry conditions although

04:33.920 --> 04:38.040
you want to be very cautious with it in the wet conditions but you want to focus on

04:38.040 --> 04:41.880
getting a good drive coming off the exit of the turn where we're going to use as much

04:41.880 --> 04:44.960
of the curve as we possibly can on the exit.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.080
You want to keep at least two wheels on the red and white curving in order to stay within

04:49.080 --> 04:53.360
track limits however in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid the curve entirely

04:53.360 --> 04:55.640
to not cost you any traction.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.880
Turn 6 is pretty much nonexistent so we then come into the braking zone for turn 7

04:59.880 --> 05:03.320
and we're going to reference the start of the curving there on the right hand side of

05:03.360 --> 05:05.360
the track as our braking point.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.720
We're going to shift the car down into second gear and actually carry a little bit more

05:08.720 --> 05:13.280
speed coming into our apex than you would initially anticipate.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.720
In the dry conditions you can use this inside slope curve pretty much no problem however

05:17.720 --> 05:22.000
you'll want to be cautious with it in the wet conditions but as we come out 3d exit

05:22.000 --> 05:25.800
we're getting hard on the throttle we're immediately coming into turn 8 and we want

05:25.800 --> 05:29.480
to try and take as much off the inside here as we possibly can.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.400
There is a row of intermittent sausage curbs on the inside here and some cars may not

05:34.400 --> 05:39.440
like you bumping over that but if your car is good at taking curbs then use this in the

05:39.440 --> 05:44.520
dry conditions keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits

05:44.520 --> 05:48.240
however you'll probably want to avoid all this curving pretty much entirely in the wet

05:48.240 --> 05:53.000
conditions as the wet slippery curbs will cost you the run going up the hill towards

05:53.000 --> 05:54.560
turn 9.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.160
This is going to be our braking point for the fast right hander at the top of the hill

05:58.720 --> 06:02.960
here it's just at the end of the red and white curving on the left hand side it's going

06:02.960 --> 06:06.960
to be a short dab of the brake and then we're going to turn the car in and let it flow through

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
the corner.

06:07.960 --> 06:12.480
We're going to apex roughly about midway through the turn we're going to be using third

06:12.480 --> 06:16.800
or fourth gear as a slight bit of camber through this turn as well you want to be cautious

06:16.800 --> 06:21.760
with this corner in that you don't really want to be using the curving on the inside

06:21.760 --> 06:26.000
in either the dry or wet conditions and you dry you can get away with brushing the

06:26.000 --> 06:30.040
curbs some cars may allow you to actually mount it but the majority of them you'll be

06:30.040 --> 06:34.960
willing to stay off it and instead focus on getting a good exit where out here we're

06:34.960 --> 06:40.320
going to use as much of the curving as we can possibly get away with stay with two wheels

06:40.320 --> 06:44.720
on that red and white serrated curving in order to stay within track limits don't venture

06:44.720 --> 06:49.800
out past that onto the FIA green curving that's out there and obviously in the wet conditions

06:49.800 --> 06:54.920
like many exit curbs you'll be willing to avoid this curving pretty much entirely.

06:54.920 --> 06:59.480
Next up is the final potential overtaking opportunity which is the break in zone for turn

06:59.480 --> 07:00.480
10.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.320
We're going to be breaking about 120 meters before the corner there is a 100 meter board

07:05.320 --> 07:08.640
there to reference on the right hand side of the track we're going to shift in all

07:08.640 --> 07:13.200
the way down into first gear and turn in the car in in both the dry and wet conditions

07:13.200 --> 07:18.400
you should be able to take plenty of the inside curve here you just need to make sure that

07:18.400 --> 07:22.720
you do get the car slowed down as this corner does feature some adverse camber which means

07:22.720 --> 07:26.040
that the track is kind of falling away from you you'll make it more difficult to actually

07:26.040 --> 07:30.680
stay hooked in towards the turn and you need to get that rotation because the exit does

07:30.680 --> 07:35.960
tighten up on you you can use the exit curving out here there is a yellow sausage curve that

07:35.960 --> 07:42.080
runs pretty much the length of the exit of turn 10 so do be mindful of that as actually

07:42.080 --> 07:46.840
dipping your outside wheels over across that can potentially unsettle the car and make

07:46.840 --> 07:51.240
it a little bit more difficult in trying to apply the power obviously in the wet conditions

07:51.240 --> 07:57.800
avoid this exit curve pretty much at all costs we then come into turn 11 no breaking

07:57.800 --> 08:03.560
zone for this corner it's literally flat out just check the car in try and take as much

08:03.560 --> 08:09.280
of the inside curve as you possibly there just to try and cut off as many meters off the

08:09.280 --> 08:15.880
circuit as you possibly can and then we pretty much immediately come into turn 12 it's

08:15.880 --> 08:19.840
going to be a very short breaking zone before we actually start to turn the car in and we're

08:19.840 --> 08:25.000
going to actually trail break as we turn into the corner as well our apex point is going

08:25.000 --> 08:29.440
to be mid to late in the turn you basically just want to hug that inside curve all the

08:29.440 --> 08:34.400
way through the corner be careful with it in the dry conditions as a can sometimes unsettle

08:34.400 --> 08:39.960
the car and obviously avoid it in the wet conditions but when we come out through the exit

08:39.960 --> 08:43.760
we're going to use the exit curve that is out here although there isn't too much space

08:43.760 --> 08:48.800
beyond it so make sure that you don't dip your wheels too far out our out into the gravel

08:48.800 --> 08:55.160
obviously use it in the dry conditions however do avoid it in the wet and rainy conditions

08:55.160 --> 09:00.400
and then we come into the breaking zone for turn 13 again light turn five there's no

09:00.400 --> 09:05.360
real reference point for the breaking zone coming into this corner is literally just

09:05.360 --> 09:11.400
basically judged off of feel and general flow but when we turn the car in we're going

09:11.400 --> 09:16.120
to aim to apex here on the red and white serrated curve which we can use in both the dry

09:16.120 --> 09:21.040
and wet conditions what we need to be careful of is the large sausage curve on the inside

09:21.040 --> 09:25.920
here we do not want to be clipping that as that will very heavily unsettle the car and

09:25.920 --> 09:30.160
then when we come out through the exit whilst we want to try and maximize the width of

09:30.160 --> 09:34.680
the track we don't actually want to be running out onto the curb on the outside here so try

09:34.680 --> 09:39.680
and avoid it in both the dry and wet conditions as what we'll need to do is try and bring the

09:39.680 --> 09:45.880
car back as far right to open up the breaking zone for turns 14 and 15 this is going to

09:45.960 --> 09:50.640
be our breaking point just before we get to the gantry that extends over the circuit we're

09:50.640 --> 09:55.080
going to shift the car down into first gear and turn into the first of the two apexes

09:55.080 --> 10:00.400
for the chicane both of the two apexes should be on the red and white rumble strip curbing

10:00.400 --> 10:05.600
you want to avoid the large red sausage curbs on the inside of both apexes as clipping

10:05.600 --> 10:10.040
these will bounce and unsettle the car and likely take you off the ideal line that you

10:10.040 --> 10:14.680
want to be taking in order to get through the chicane smoothly coming out 3d exit of

10:14.680 --> 10:19.320
the chicane we got a sun-concerated curb to contend with along with a long yellow sausage

10:19.320 --> 10:24.080
curve that is there in the dry conditions a number of drivers and cars will be able

10:24.080 --> 10:28.520
to take this curve to try and maximize the speed coming off of the corner you want to

10:28.520 --> 10:33.800
avoid it in the wet conditions as the slippery painted surfaces will cost you the traction

10:33.800 --> 10:39.120
and then we come into the final corner itself turns 16 there's no breaking zone for this

10:39.120 --> 10:42.840
corner so it's literally just trying to take a nice smooth line coming through the

10:42.840 --> 10:47.040
turn we're going to clip the apex at midway point we're going to stay off the inside

10:47.040 --> 10:51.640
curve coming through the corners it can potentially unsettle the car in both the dry and also

10:51.640 --> 10:56.600
the wet conditions and then as we come out 3d exit what to unwind the wheel keep your foot

10:56.600 --> 11:02.720
fully planted maximize the exit curbing out here staying with two wheels on that red

11:02.720 --> 11:08.480
and white serrated curve because extending over that we'll see you infringing track limits

11:08.480 --> 11:12.360
and obviously in the wet conditions you'll probably want to be avoiding this curve pretty

11:12.360 --> 11:16.840
much entirely as it will likely light up the rear tires and then cost you the run to

11:16.840 --> 11:21.800
the start finish line to complete your lap so now that we've done a breakdown of all

11:21.800 --> 11:25.160
the corners let's jump in the car and see how it looks piece together

13:13.000 --> 13:20.360
so now that we've finished a semi-decent lap around Catalonia I just want to finish off the

13:20.360 --> 13:26.440
episode by saying please be mindful of what your car and car setup is capable of some cars

13:26.440 --> 13:32.200
will be able to break a little bit later than others some cars will be able to take curves better

13:32.200 --> 13:37.400
than others so obviously going to be dependent on your car setup might have a slight factor as

13:37.400 --> 13:42.680
well and then obviously the weather conditions are going to play a factor too obviously I've tried

13:42.680 --> 13:48.200
to highlight these things where possible but please do take note and obviously apply accordingly

13:48.200 --> 13:53.240
to the session race or conditions that you're driving in other than that thank you very much for
