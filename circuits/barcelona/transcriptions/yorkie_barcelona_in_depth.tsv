0	10000	Hello there, it's Yorky and welcome to the channel for the 10th episode of the in-depth
10000	13600	track guide series for a setter coaster competition journey.
13600	17560	And just quickly before we get into all the juicy details that are going to help you improve
17560	21880	your lap times around this circuit, if you're new to the channel and enjoying this in-depth
21880	26360	track guide series then please consider subscribing to the channel, it will be very much appreciated.
26360	30320	If you want to follow me on other social media pages my links are down in description
30320	31320	below.
31320	36800	So for this 10th episode we are going to be taking a look at Barcelona Catalonia in Spain.
36800	44480	The circuit itself comes out to 2.89 miles which is 4.65 kilometers and features 16 turns.
44480	48160	The setup that you want to be using for the circuit should be run about medium downforce
48160	52800	with medium suspension stiffness and then the key action areas where there's possibility
52800	59800	for overtaking will be turns 1, turns 4, 5, 7 and turn 10.
59800	63600	Next up we're going to take a look at the pit entry and the pit exit and the entrance
63600	68080	to the pit lane is just between the penultimate corner and the final corner just before you
68080	70360	turn the car into that turn 16.
70360	73920	It's there on the inside you may need to slow a little bit as you come into the pit
73920	79160	lane and then you will need to slow down and get the car engaged onto the pit limiter.
79160	85080	About 70 or 80 meters before the end of the white concrete wall that's there on the inside
85080	89680	this is where the pit limiter line is actually situated and then at the other end of the
89680	94720	pit lane the pit exit is right next to the Barcelona Martial Hut that you can see situated
94720	95720	here.
95720	99440	At this point you want to disengage the pit limiter and accelerate out, down, back, out
99440	100440	onto the circuit.
100440	105200	The pit exit line actually extends pretty far down towards turn 1 so make sure you step
105200	108560	to the right of that when coming out of the pit lane.
108560	111800	So we're going to move on to the track itself and we're obviously going to be starting
111800	114280	off with the breaking point for the first corner.
114280	118800	It's about 120 meters before the turn we're going to be breaking hard and shifting down
118800	120320	into second gear.
120320	124000	We're then going to turn the car in towards our first apex aiming to clip the inside
124000	126240	curve which you can use in the dry conditions.
126240	129160	You want to be careful with it in the wet conditions.
129160	133440	The curve as you can see is serrated and there is a slight sloshish curve on the inside
133440	135440	here so you want to be careful of that.
135440	139760	But coming off the exit of turn 1 which you'll want to sacrifice, we're immediately coming
139760	141560	into turn 2.
141560	143600	This is going to be your typical apex point.
143600	147800	Some cars will allow you to use the inside curve but others you'll need to be very cautious
147800	152840	with in both the dry and wet conditions as again quite easily unsettle the car.
152840	157440	But as we come out the exit of turn 2, we don't want to run all the way over to the right
157440	161200	hand side of the circuit where there's that painted tarmac and the astroturfing want
161200	167040	to stay just shy of that to try and open up turn 3 which pretty much immediately follows.
167040	171120	You're going to turn the car in whilst on full throttle and as we come through the corner
171120	175280	you'll need to lift a little bit and close the car through the turn to try and keep it
175280	177360	hooked up towards the inside.
177360	181520	And then as you progress through the turn just off the inside curve as soon as you see
181520	186200	a second set of orange painted tire barriers on the outside that is when you want to be
186200	190000	getting full throttle and accelerating out through the exit.
190000	193520	Right here there is plenty of tarmac to run off onto.
193520	197480	You need to keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits.
197480	202120	You can use this in the dry conditions however you want to be very cautious in the wet
202120	205320	potentially avoid it if entirely possible.
205320	208480	But we're going to stay out here to the left of the circuit ready for the braking zone
208480	212720	of turn 4 which is just before we get to the bridge at the large white line that's just
212720	213760	to the left of the track.
213760	218400	We're going to brake heavily at this point and shift down into first or second gear
218400	223040	aiming for a very early apex where we're going to just brush the curve on the inside
223040	227000	there and run the car a tiny little bit deep and then we're going to try and bring it
227000	233200	back a little bit towards a second later apex as we continue to accelerate and turn through
233200	234600	the corner.
234600	238480	As we're coming off the exit of turn 4 though we don't actually want to run all the
238480	241040	way out towards this exit curving.
241040	245120	You can use it in the dry conditions if you want but you want to avoid it in the wet
245120	249480	conditions as the rumble strip nature of it will cost you the traction but what you want
249480	253480	to do is bring the car immediately back over towards the right hand side of the track ready
253480	256320	to open up turn 5 and this is our braking point.
256320	260880	There's no real reference in and around here so it's pretty much just down to getting
260880	265080	the flow and using your pure judgement for this corner.
265080	269320	So turning in at apex it's actually going to be fairly late in the turn.
269320	273920	You want to get fairly close to the inside curve you can use it in the dry conditions although
273920	278040	you want to be very cautious with it in the wet conditions but you want to focus on
278040	281880	getting a good drive coming off the exit of the turn where we're going to use as much
281880	284960	of the curve as we possibly can on the exit.
284960	289080	You want to keep at least two wheels on the red and white curving in order to stay within
289080	293360	track limits however in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid the curve entirely
293360	295640	to not cost you any traction.
295640	299880	Turn 6 is pretty much nonexistent so we then come into the braking zone for turn 7
299880	303320	and we're going to reference the start of the curving there on the right hand side of
303360	305360	the track as our braking point.
305360	308720	We're going to shift the car down into second gear and actually carry a little bit more
308720	313280	speed coming into our apex than you would initially anticipate.
313280	317720	In the dry conditions you can use this inside slope curve pretty much no problem however
317720	322000	you'll want to be cautious with it in the wet conditions but as we come out 3d exit
322000	325800	we're getting hard on the throttle we're immediately coming into turn 8 and we want
325800	329480	to try and take as much off the inside here as we possibly can.
329480	334400	There is a row of intermittent sausage curbs on the inside here and some cars may not
334400	339440	like you bumping over that but if your car is good at taking curbs then use this in the
339440	344520	dry conditions keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits
344520	348240	however you'll probably want to avoid all this curving pretty much entirely in the wet
348240	353000	conditions as the wet slippery curbs will cost you the run going up the hill towards
353000	354560	turn 9.
354560	358160	This is going to be our braking point for the fast right hander at the top of the hill
358720	362960	here it's just at the end of the red and white curving on the left hand side it's going
362960	366960	to be a short dab of the brake and then we're going to turn the car in and let it flow through
366960	367960	the corner.
367960	372480	We're going to apex roughly about midway through the turn we're going to be using third
372480	376800	or fourth gear as a slight bit of camber through this turn as well you want to be cautious
376800	381760	with this corner in that you don't really want to be using the curving on the inside
381760	386000	in either the dry or wet conditions and you dry you can get away with brushing the
386000	390040	curbs some cars may allow you to actually mount it but the majority of them you'll be
390040	394960	willing to stay off it and instead focus on getting a good exit where out here we're
394960	400320	going to use as much of the curving as we can possibly get away with stay with two wheels
400320	404720	on that red and white serrated curving in order to stay within track limits don't venture
404720	409800	out past that onto the FIA green curving that's out there and obviously in the wet conditions
409800	414920	like many exit curbs you'll be willing to avoid this curving pretty much entirely.
414920	419480	Next up is the final potential overtaking opportunity which is the break in zone for turn
419480	420480	10.
420480	425320	We're going to be breaking about 120 meters before the corner there is a 100 meter board
425320	428640	there to reference on the right hand side of the track we're going to shift in all
428640	433200	the way down into first gear and turn in the car in in both the dry and wet conditions
433200	438400	you should be able to take plenty of the inside curve here you just need to make sure that
438400	442720	you do get the car slowed down as this corner does feature some adverse camber which means
442720	446040	that the track is kind of falling away from you you'll make it more difficult to actually
446040	450680	stay hooked in towards the turn and you need to get that rotation because the exit does
450680	455960	tighten up on you you can use the exit curving out here there is a yellow sausage curve that
455960	462080	runs pretty much the length of the exit of turn 10 so do be mindful of that as actually
462080	466840	dipping your outside wheels over across that can potentially unsettle the car and make
466840	471240	it a little bit more difficult in trying to apply the power obviously in the wet conditions
471240	477800	avoid this exit curve pretty much at all costs we then come into turn 11 no breaking
477800	483560	zone for this corner it's literally flat out just check the car in try and take as much
483560	489280	of the inside curve as you possibly there just to try and cut off as many meters off the
489280	495880	circuit as you possibly can and then we pretty much immediately come into turn 12 it's
495880	499840	going to be a very short breaking zone before we actually start to turn the car in and we're
499840	505000	going to actually trail break as we turn into the corner as well our apex point is going
505000	509440	to be mid to late in the turn you basically just want to hug that inside curve all the
509440	514400	way through the corner be careful with it in the dry conditions as a can sometimes unsettle
514400	519960	the car and obviously avoid it in the wet conditions but when we come out through the exit
519960	523760	we're going to use the exit curve that is out here although there isn't too much space
523760	528800	beyond it so make sure that you don't dip your wheels too far out our out into the gravel
528800	535160	obviously use it in the dry conditions however do avoid it in the wet and rainy conditions
535160	540400	and then we come into the breaking zone for turn 13 again light turn five there's no
540400	545360	real reference point for the breaking zone coming into this corner is literally just
545360	551400	basically judged off of feel and general flow but when we turn the car in we're going
551400	556120	to aim to apex here on the red and white serrated curve which we can use in both the dry
556120	561040	and wet conditions what we need to be careful of is the large sausage curve on the inside
561040	565920	here we do not want to be clipping that as that will very heavily unsettle the car and
565920	570160	then when we come out through the exit whilst we want to try and maximize the width of
570160	574680	the track we don't actually want to be running out onto the curb on the outside here so try
574680	579680	and avoid it in both the dry and wet conditions as what we'll need to do is try and bring the
579680	585880	car back as far right to open up the breaking zone for turns 14 and 15 this is going to
585960	590640	be our breaking point just before we get to the gantry that extends over the circuit we're
590640	595080	going to shift the car down into first gear and turn into the first of the two apexes
595080	600400	for the chicane both of the two apexes should be on the red and white rumble strip curbing
600400	605600	you want to avoid the large red sausage curbs on the inside of both apexes as clipping
605600	610040	these will bounce and unsettle the car and likely take you off the ideal line that you
610040	614680	want to be taking in order to get through the chicane smoothly coming out 3d exit of
614680	619320	the chicane we got a sun-concerated curb to contend with along with a long yellow sausage
619320	624080	curve that is there in the dry conditions a number of drivers and cars will be able
624080	628520	to take this curve to try and maximize the speed coming off of the corner you want to
628520	633800	avoid it in the wet conditions as the slippery painted surfaces will cost you the traction
633800	639120	and then we come into the final corner itself turns 16 there's no breaking zone for this
639120	642840	corner so it's literally just trying to take a nice smooth line coming through the
642840	647040	turn we're going to clip the apex at midway point we're going to stay off the inside
647040	651640	curve coming through the corners it can potentially unsettle the car in both the dry and also
651640	656600	the wet conditions and then as we come out 3d exit what to unwind the wheel keep your foot
656600	662720	fully planted maximize the exit curbing out here staying with two wheels on that red
662720	668480	and white serrated curve because extending over that we'll see you infringing track limits
668480	672360	and obviously in the wet conditions you'll probably want to be avoiding this curve pretty
672360	676840	much entirely as it will likely light up the rear tires and then cost you the run to
676840	681800	the start finish line to complete your lap so now that we've done a breakdown of all
681800	685160	the corners let's jump in the car and see how it looks piece together
793000	800360	so now that we've finished a semi-decent lap around Catalonia I just want to finish off the
800360	806440	episode by saying please be mindful of what your car and car setup is capable of some cars
806440	812200	will be able to break a little bit later than others some cars will be able to take curves better
812200	817400	than others so obviously going to be dependent on your car setup might have a slight factor as
817400	822680	well and then obviously the weather conditions are going to play a factor too obviously I've tried
822680	828200	to highlight these things where possible but please do take note and obviously apply accordingly
828200	833240	to the session race or conditions that you're driving in other than that thank you very much for
