0	9640	Hello everybody, my name is John and welcome to a brand new series on the traction channel.
9640	12600	In this series we'll be working our way through all of the available circuits on a settle
12600	17040	course or competition, helping you find those extra seconds you have been painfully seeking.
17040	21080	For our first edition, we'll be taking a closer look at the circuit to Barcelona Catalonia.
21080	23920	This track is a great place to start, as it's one of the most commonly used in Europe
23920	26120	for all disciplines of high profile motorsport.
26120	29600	It's also a circuit you can find in pretty much any racing game or sim, so it's a good one
29600	30600	to know inside out.
30600	34120	For this video, we have selected the Porsche 911 as it suits the tight and to a signature
34120	35120	of the venue well.
35120	38080	Don't forget that if you want to see other car and track combinations, you can subscribe
38080	42080	to the traction channel and hit the notification bell to see them as they're released.
42080	47760	So without further ado, let's jump into the analysis.
47760	51200	So as the lap begins, you have plenty of time to sort yourself out for turn one.
51200	54160	Keep an eye out for the braking markers and the fence and get right up onto the curb
54160	57480	and runoff area on the left hand side before the corner, as long as you keep two wheels
57480	59280	inside the white line.
59280	63200	Take just before the 100 board and change down through all the gears to second.
63200	67000	You can roll off the brake as you approach the apex, just to let the car turn freely,
67000	70320	using the curb on the inside but watching out for the little race block.
70320	73480	Once you get through, grab third gear and slightly feather the throttle as you get through
73480	74480	turn two.
74480	78080	Again, it's a similar situation with the curbs, you want to use the standard curb without
78080	79560	hitting the race block.
79560	82320	Throughout this section, it's mainly a case of modulating your throttle input to keep
82320	84520	the car on the perfect line and well balanced.
84520	87840	If you can, try and stay to the left of the circuit in order to prepare yourself for
87840	89600	the infamous turn three.
89600	92680	As you pass the small section of black runoff that lies between the grass areas on the
92680	96480	left of the circuit, turn in and short shift to fourth, staying on the throttle.
96480	99360	This corner is incredibly long, so don't worry about being a reasonable distance from
99360	102520	the apex of the beginning, it's then a case of rolling off the throttle based on how
102520	106400	much grip you have underneath you, whilst aiming to hit the apex midway through the corner.
106400	109520	Once you get there and ideally kiss the curb on the inside, put your foot down fully
109520	111320	and let the car do the work.
111320	114320	Open up your steering as you head to the corner exit and use all of the room you need in
114320	116080	order to carry maximum speed.
116080	118320	Keep your car way over to the left for turn four.
118320	121240	It might seem mad, but you can use a huge amount of the runoff area in this particular
121240	122240	section.
122240	125680	As long as you keep two wheels on the curb, you won't be penalised somehow, so I suggest
125680	126680	making the most of it.
126680	129520	Start your braking just before you cross the white strip that runs across the runoff
129520	131480	area, just below the bridge.
131480	134920	You want to trail brake here, turning in and shifting down to second.
134920	138120	As you get closer, you want to roll off the brake, allowing the front of the car to turn
138120	139120	in nicely.
139120	142560	I should emphasise that this technique works well in cars such as the Porsche, Audi or
142560	145280	BMW, but not necessarily every car.
145280	148840	So if you've taken something like a Bentley to Spain, then I can only apologise, you might
148840	152080	need to sacrifice a little bit of lap time and scrub off slightly more speed.
152080	155440	But anyway, as I was saying, you get the nose of the car in and you want to aim to hit
155440	158320	the apex midway through the corner, touching the inside curb.
158320	161080	Get on the power as early as possible and open up your steering.
161080	163440	Just be careful for oversteer here, which could be quite common.
163440	166480	Use as much as the track as you need on the exit whilst keeping it pinned, and quickly
166480	169480	haul yourself back over to the right to prepare for turn five.
169480	172680	It's very tricky to point out a specific reference point here for braking because there
172680	174440	isn't really much to go on.
174440	177520	There's a tower on the left that lines up reasonably well with the ideal braking point,
177520	180680	but if you were looking at that tower whilst approaching the braking zone, you're definitely
180680	182200	doing something wrong.
182200	185880	With this one, it's just a case of practise and getting used to how it feels.
185880	187640	Change down to second and turn in.
187640	191600	With this corner, you want to just miss the inside on the entry in order to cut back.
191600	194680	Get the late apex and get on the power as early as possible.
194680	197920	Use most of the exit curb, just watch out for track limits as always.
197920	200680	You want to stay towards the right hand side through the kink and focus on your entry
200680	202160	into turn seven.
202160	204160	Straight in the car and place it next to the curb.
204240	208200	Just before the curb begins, change down to second and roll off the brake, turning in
208200	211600	early and letting the camber of the corner slow the car down and hold you on that racing
211600	212600	line.
212600	215760	At the apex, you want to be fully over the red and white curb, but watch out for the green
215760	218160	area as it can be a bit unpredictable.
218160	221920	Get back on the power at the apex and use the green runoff area on the exit, also cutting
221920	224120	the weak curbs in the direction change.
224120	227520	Stay left and at the end of the entry curbing, lift off the throttle.
227520	230600	You don't actually need to brake here when hot lapping, but might do with a heavy fuel
230600	233720	load and a car that's maybe less suited to these style of corners.
233720	237200	Turn in and use a wee bit of power when required in order to keep the car on the line and
237200	238200	in shape.
238200	242320	Aim to hit the apex midway through the corner, just touching the red and white curb.
242320	246160	Try to carry as much speed as possible and use all of the exit curb and run off.
246160	251760	Drift back to the right and brake comfortably before the 100m boat.
251760	255280	Shift all the way down to first and get over the red and white curbing on the apex.
255280	258360	Get back on the power watching for oversteer and use the exit curb.
258360	260680	For turn 11, some cars can cut more than others.
260680	263800	In this lap, I stuck to the red and white curb and avoided the green section as it can
263800	267440	sometimes throw you off, but see how your car handles it when you try it.
267440	271320	Straighten the steering and get on the brakes instantly, changing down to second.
271320	274760	Try to hold a nice tight line through here, getting on the power nice and early and using
274760	276680	all of the available space on the exit.
276680	278200	Stay out there for turn 13.
278200	281440	Again, there are a lack of reference points here, but this one feels fairly straightforward
281440	283240	when you try it for yourself.
283240	287520	Brake, change down to second and get the car in over the red and white apex curb, avoiding
287520	289640	that sausage curb at all costs.
289640	292560	Straighten the power again and haul the car back to the right.
292560	295440	On this occasion, I was slightly further to the left and therefore was compromised
295440	298800	since the chicane, so try and be even further over if you can.
298800	302200	Again, there aren't many reference points here, but as you can see the corner, it's a
302200	304400	bit easier to judge it based on feel.
304400	306680	Shift down to first and use the inside curbs.
306680	310760	Quickly change direction, short shift and again use the flat section of curbing while on
310760	313320	throttle to optimise your exit speed.
313320	316600	Try and let the yellow sausage curb hold your car online, if you understood over the top
316600	319960	of that curb your car can bottom out and you will lose exit speed and receive a try
319960	320960	limits warning.
320960	323800	So just be careful not to put on too much power too soon.
323800	327240	The last corner is simple enough flat out, just make sure you kiss the inside white line
327240	330000	midway through the corner to avoid any understeer.
330000	334000	Use the exit curb and that is a lap of the circuit de Barcelona Catalonia.
334000	336960	Now let's take a look at it in full speed to give you some context as to how it all
426960	442120	looks.
442120	444920	This is the lap time I managed to set in this video, as well as a couple of reference
444920	446640	laps for you guys to aim for.
446640	449640	The AM lap represents a good starting point when you're first learning the circuit, the
449640	453280	Pro AM lap is a good place to be if you're looking to be competitive online, and of course
453280	455680	the Pro lap is for the fastest guys in the world.
455680	459120	Hopefully you've managed to pinpoint a few areas where you can improve your lap times.
459120	462280	When it comes to ACC, always bear in mind that there's a huge amount of variables at
462280	464120	play compared to most games.
464120	467360	Some cars can be up to a second off the pace and a track that doesn't suit them.
467360	470440	Temperatures and track grip levels can also play a big part, so don't worry too much
470440	474000	about your ultimate lap time, just focus on getting each corner right and results will
474000	475920	begin to swing your way.
475920	479120	Just before we finish up, I'm going to attempt to summarise the key points about this circuit
479120	480120	in 10 seconds.
480120	484240	You never know, it might just come in handy if you have 35 seconds until your race starts,
484240	487320	but you've done no practice, and you have your YouTube tab open.
487320	489400	Use all this space and entry and roll through to turn one use curves, but not the blocks
489400	492400	focus on late effects to keep the car nicely in line for a turn 3, 4 or 5 car speed and
492400	495160	early for 7 don't break for 9, abuse the curve and for 10 and 11 keep it tight for 12 and
495160	498360	13 smooth to the chicane, wash the high curves and focus on your exit.
498360	500800	Thanks very much for tuning in, and hopefully you enjoyed the video.
500800	503760	If you did, we would love it if you could leave us a like and subscribe to the traction
503760	504760	channel.
