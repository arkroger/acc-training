00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Hello everybody, my name is John and welcome to a brand new series on the traction channel.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,600
In this series we'll be working our way through all of the available circuits on a settle

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,040
course or competition, helping you find those extra seconds you have been painfully seeking.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,080
For our first edition, we'll be taking a closer look at the circuit to Barcelona Catalonia.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,920
This track is a great place to start, as it's one of the most commonly used in Europe

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,120
for all disciplines of high profile motorsport.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,600
It's also a circuit you can find in pretty much any racing game or sim, so it's a good one

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
to know inside out.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,120
For this video, we have selected the Porsche 911 as it suits the tight and to a signature

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
of the venue well.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,080
Don't forget that if you want to see other car and track combinations, you can subscribe

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,080
to the traction channel and hit the notification bell to see them as they're released.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,760
So without further ado, let's jump into the analysis.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,200
So as the lap begins, you have plenty of time to sort yourself out for turn one.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,160
Keep an eye out for the braking markers and the fence and get right up onto the curb

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,480
and runoff area on the left hand side before the corner, as long as you keep two wheels

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
inside the white line.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,200
Take just before the 100 board and change down through all the gears to second.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,000
You can roll off the brake as you approach the apex, just to let the car turn freely,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,320
using the curb on the inside but watching out for the little race block.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,480
Once you get through, grab third gear and slightly feather the throttle as you get through

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
turn two.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,080
Again, it's a similar situation with the curbs, you want to use the standard curb without

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,560
hitting the race block.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,320
Throughout this section, it's mainly a case of modulating your throttle input to keep

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,520
the car on the perfect line and well balanced.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,840
If you can, try and stay to the left of the circuit in order to prepare yourself for

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
the infamous turn three.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,680
As you pass the small section of black runoff that lies between the grass areas on the

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,480
left of the circuit, turn in and short shift to fourth, staying on the throttle.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,360
This corner is incredibly long, so don't worry about being a reasonable distance from

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,520
the apex of the beginning, it's then a case of rolling off the throttle based on how

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,400
much grip you have underneath you, whilst aiming to hit the apex midway through the corner.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,520
Once you get there and ideally kiss the curb on the inside, put your foot down fully

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,320
and let the car do the work.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Open up your steering as you head to the corner exit and use all of the room you need in

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
order to carry maximum speed.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,320
Keep your car way over to the left for turn four.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,240
It might seem mad, but you can use a huge amount of the runoff area in this particular

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
section.

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
As long as you keep two wheels on the curb, you won't be penalised somehow, so I suggest

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
making the most of it.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Start your braking just before you cross the white strip that runs across the runoff

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,480
area, just below the bridge.

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,920
You want to trail brake here, turning in and shifting down to second.

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
As you get closer, you want to roll off the brake, allowing the front of the car to turn

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
in nicely.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
I should emphasise that this technique works well in cars such as the Porsche, Audi or

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
BMW, but not necessarily every car.

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,840
So if you've taken something like a Bentley to Spain, then I can only apologise, you might

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,080
need to sacrifice a little bit of lap time and scrub off slightly more speed.

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
But anyway, as I was saying, you get the nose of the car in and you want to aim to hit

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,320
the apex midway through the corner, touching the inside curb.

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,080
Get on the power as early as possible and open up your steering.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,440
Just be careful for oversteer here, which could be quite common.

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
Use as much as the track as you need on the exit whilst keeping it pinned, and quickly

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
haul yourself back over to the right to prepare for turn five.

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,680
It's very tricky to point out a specific reference point here for braking because there

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,440
isn't really much to go on.

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,520
There's a tower on the left that lines up reasonably well with the ideal braking point,

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,680
but if you were looking at that tower whilst approaching the braking zone, you're definitely

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
doing something wrong.

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,880
With this one, it's just a case of practise and getting used to how it feels.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,640
Change down to second and turn in.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,600
With this corner, you want to just miss the inside on the entry in order to cut back.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,680
Get the late apex and get on the power as early as possible.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,920
Use most of the exit curb, just watch out for track limits as always.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,680
You want to stay towards the right hand side through the kink and focus on your entry

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,160
into turn seven.

70
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Straight in the car and place it next to the curb.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,200
Just before the curb begins, change down to second and roll off the brake, turning in

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,600
early and letting the camber of the corner slow the car down and hold you on that racing

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
line.

74
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,760
At the apex, you want to be fully over the red and white curb, but watch out for the green

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,160
area as it can be a bit unpredictable.

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,920
Get back on the power at the apex and use the green runoff area on the exit, also cutting

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,120
the weak curbs in the direction change.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
Stay left and at the end of the entry curbing, lift off the throttle.

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,600
You don't actually need to brake here when hot lapping, but might do with a heavy fuel

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,720
load and a car that's maybe less suited to these style of corners.

81
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Turn in and use a wee bit of power when required in order to keep the car on the line and

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
in shape.

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Aim to hit the apex midway through the corner, just touching the red and white curb.

84
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Try to carry as much speed as possible and use all of the exit curb and run off.

85
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,760
Drift back to the right and brake comfortably before the 100m boat.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
Shift all the way down to first and get over the red and white curbing on the apex.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,360
Get back on the power watching for oversteer and use the exit curb.

88
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,680
For turn 11, some cars can cut more than others.

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,800
In this lap, I stuck to the red and white curb and avoided the green section as it can

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
sometimes throw you off, but see how your car handles it when you try it.

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Straighten the steering and get on the brakes instantly, changing down to second.

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Try to hold a nice tight line through here, getting on the power nice and early and using

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,680
all of the available space on the exit.

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,200
Stay out there for turn 13.

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,440
Again, there are a lack of reference points here, but this one feels fairly straightforward

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
when you try it for yourself.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,520
Brake, change down to second and get the car in over the red and white apex curb, avoiding

98
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,640
that sausage curb at all costs.

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Straighten the power again and haul the car back to the right.

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
On this occasion, I was slightly further to the left and therefore was compromised

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,800
since the chicane, so try and be even further over if you can.

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Again, there aren't many reference points here, but as you can see the corner, it's a

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,400
bit easier to judge it based on feel.

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,680
Shift down to first and use the inside curbs.

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,760
Quickly change direction, short shift and again use the flat section of curbing while on

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,320
throttle to optimise your exit speed.

107
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,600
Try and let the yellow sausage curb hold your car online, if you understood over the top

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,960
of that curb your car can bottom out and you will lose exit speed and receive a try

109
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
limits warning.

110
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,800
So just be careful not to put on too much power too soon.

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,240
The last corner is simple enough flat out, just make sure you kiss the inside white line

112
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,000
midway through the corner to avoid any understeer.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Use the exit curb and that is a lap of the circuit de Barcelona Catalonia.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Now let's take a look at it in full speed to give you some context as to how it all

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:22,120
looks.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,920
This is the lap time I managed to set in this video, as well as a couple of reference

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
laps for you guys to aim for.

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
The AM lap represents a good starting point when you're first learning the circuit, the

119
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,280
Pro AM lap is a good place to be if you're looking to be competitive online, and of course

120
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,680
the Pro lap is for the fastest guys in the world.

121
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Hopefully you've managed to pinpoint a few areas where you can improve your lap times.

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,280
When it comes to ACC, always bear in mind that there's a huge amount of variables at

123
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
play compared to most games.

124
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,360
Some cars can be up to a second off the pace and a track that doesn't suit them.

125
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,440
Temperatures and track grip levels can also play a big part, so don't worry too much

126
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,000
about your ultimate lap time, just focus on getting each corner right and results will

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
begin to swing your way.

128
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Just before we finish up, I'm going to attempt to summarise the key points about this circuit

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
in 10 seconds.

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,240
You never know, it might just come in handy if you have 35 seconds until your race starts,

131
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,320
but you've done no practice, and you have your YouTube tab open.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,400
Use all this space and entry and roll through to turn one use curves, but not the blocks

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
focus on late effects to keep the car nicely in line for a turn 3, 4 or 5 car speed and

134
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,160
early for 7 don't break for 9, abuse the curve and for 10 and 11 keep it tight for 12 and

135
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,360
13 smooth to the chicane, wash the high curves and focus on your exit.

136
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,800
Thanks very much for tuning in, and hopefully you enjoyed the video.
