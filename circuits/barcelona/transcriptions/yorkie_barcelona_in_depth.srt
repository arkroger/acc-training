below.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,800
So for this 10th episode we are going to be taking a look at Barcelona Catalonia in Spain.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,480
The circuit itself comes out to 2.89 miles which is 4.65 kilometers and features 16 turns.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
The setup that you want to be using for the circuit should be run about medium downforce

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,800
with medium suspension stiffness and then the key action areas where there's possibility

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,800
for overtaking will be turns 1, turns 4, 5, 7 and turn 10.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
Next up we're going to take a look at the pit entry and the pit exit and the entrance

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
to the pit lane is just between the penultimate corner and the final corner just before you

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,360
turn the car into that turn 16.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,920
It's there on the inside you may need to slow a little bit as you come into the pit

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,160
lane and then you will need to slow down and get the car engaged onto the pit limiter.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,080
About 70 or 80 meters before the end of the white concrete wall that's there on the inside

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,680
this is where the pit limiter line is actually situated and then at the other end of the

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,720
pit lane the pit exit is right next to the Barcelona Martial Hut that you can see situated

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
here.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,440
At this point you want to disengage the pit limiter and accelerate out, down, back, out

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
onto the circuit.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,200
The pit exit line actually extends pretty far down towards turn 1 so make sure you step

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
to the right of that when coming out of the pit lane.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,800
So we're going to move on to the track itself and we're obviously going to be starting

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,280
off with the breaking point for the first corner.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,800
It's about 120 meters before the turn we're going to be breaking hard and shifting down

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
into second gear.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
We're then going to turn the car in towards our first apex aiming to clip the inside

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
curve which you can use in the dry conditions.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,160
You want to be careful with it in the wet conditions.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,440
The curve as you can see is serrated and there is a slight sloshish curve on the inside

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
here so you want to be careful of that.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
But coming off the exit of turn 1 which you'll want to sacrifice, we're immediately coming

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
into turn 2.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,600
This is going to be your typical apex point.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Some cars will allow you to use the inside curve but others you'll need to be very cautious

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,840
with in both the dry and wet conditions as again quite easily unsettle the car.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,440
But as we come out the exit of turn 2, we don't want to run all the way over to the right

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
hand side of the circuit where there's that painted tarmac and the astroturfing want

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
to stay just shy of that to try and open up turn 3 which pretty much immediately follows.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
You're going to turn the car in whilst on full throttle and as we come through the corner

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
you'll need to lift a little bit and close the car through the turn to try and keep it

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
hooked up towards the inside.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,520
And then as you progress through the turn just off the inside curve as soon as you see

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,200
a second set of orange painted tire barriers on the outside that is when you want to be

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,000
getting full throttle and accelerating out through the exit.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Right here there is plenty of tarmac to run off onto.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,480
You need to keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits.

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,120
You can use this in the dry conditions however you want to be very cautious in the wet

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,320
potentially avoid it if entirely possible.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,480
But we're going to stay out here to the left of the circuit ready for the braking zone

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
of turn 4 which is just before we get to the bridge at the large white line that's just

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,760
to the left of the track.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
We're going to brake heavily at this point and shift down into first or second gear

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
aiming for a very early apex where we're going to just brush the curve on the inside

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,000
there and run the car a tiny little bit deep and then we're going to try and bring it

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,200
back a little bit towards a second later apex as we continue to accelerate and turn through

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
the corner.

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,480
As we're coming off the exit of turn 4 though we don't actually want to run all the

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
way out towards this exit curving.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,120
You can use it in the dry conditions if you want but you want to avoid it in the wet

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,480
conditions as the rumble strip nature of it will cost you the traction but what you want

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,480
to do is bring the car immediately back over towards the right hand side of the track ready

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,320
to open up turn 5 and this is our braking point.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,880
There's no real reference in and around here so it's pretty much just down to getting

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,080
the flow and using your pure judgement for this corner.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,320
So turning in at apex it's actually going to be fairly late in the turn.

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,920
You want to get fairly close to the inside curve you can use it in the dry conditions although

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,040
you want to be very cautious with it in the wet conditions but you want to focus on

72
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,880
getting a good drive coming off the exit of the turn where we're going to use as much

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,960
of the curve as we possibly can on the exit.

74
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,080
You want to keep at least two wheels on the red and white curving in order to stay within

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,360
track limits however in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid the curve entirely

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,640
to not cost you any traction.

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,880
Turn 6 is pretty much nonexistent so we then come into the braking zone for turn 7

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,320
and we're going to reference the start of the curving there on the right hand side of

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
the track as our braking point.

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
We're going to shift the car down into second gear and actually carry a little bit more

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
speed coming into our apex than you would initially anticipate.

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,720
In the dry conditions you can use this inside slope curve pretty much no problem however

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,000
you'll want to be cautious with it in the wet conditions but as we come out 3d exit

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,800
we're getting hard on the throttle we're immediately coming into turn 8 and we want

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,480
to try and take as much off the inside here as we possibly can.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,400
There is a row of intermittent sausage curbs on the inside here and some cars may not

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,440
like you bumping over that but if your car is good at taking curbs then use this in the

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,520
dry conditions keep two wheels on the red and white curving to stay within track limits

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,240
however you'll probably want to avoid all this curving pretty much entirely in the wet

90
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,000
conditions as the wet slippery curbs will cost you the run going up the hill towards

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,560
turn 9.

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
This is going to be our braking point for the fast right hander at the top of the hill

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
here it's just at the end of the red and white curving on the left hand side it's going

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
to be a short dab of the brake and then we're going to turn the car in and let it flow through

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
the corner.

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,480
We're going to apex roughly about midway through the turn we're going to be using third

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,800
or fourth gear as a slight bit of camber through this turn as well you want to be cautious

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,760
with this corner in that you don't really want to be using the curving on the inside

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,000
in either the dry or wet conditions and you dry you can get away with brushing the

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,040
curbs some cars may allow you to actually mount it but the majority of them you'll be

101
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,960
willing to stay off it and instead focus on getting a good exit where out here we're

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,320
going to use as much of the curving as we can possibly get away with stay with two wheels

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,720
on that red and white serrated curving in order to stay within track limits don't venture

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,800
out past that onto the FIA green curving that's out there and obviously in the wet conditions

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,920
like many exit curbs you'll be willing to avoid this curving pretty much entirely.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,480
Next up is the final potential overtaking opportunity which is the break in zone for turn

107
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
10.

108
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,320
We're going to be breaking about 120 meters before the corner there is a 100 meter board

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,640
there to reference on the right hand side of the track we're going to shift in all

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,200
the way down into first gear and turn in the car in in both the dry and wet conditions

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,400
you should be able to take plenty of the inside curve here you just need to make sure that

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,720
you do get the car slowed down as this corner does feature some adverse camber which means

113
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,040
that the track is kind of falling away from you you'll make it more difficult to actually

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,680
stay hooked in towards the turn and you need to get that rotation because the exit does

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,960
tighten up on you you can use the exit curving out here there is a yellow sausage curve that

116
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,080
runs pretty much the length of the exit of turn 10 so do be mindful of that as actually

117
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,840
dipping your outside wheels over across that can potentially unsettle the car and make

118
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,240
it a little bit more difficult in trying to apply the power obviously in the wet conditions

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,800
avoid this exit curve pretty much at all costs we then come into turn 11 no breaking

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,560
zone for this corner it's literally flat out just check the car in try and take as much

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,280
of the inside curve as you possibly there just to try and cut off as many meters off the

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,880
circuit as you possibly can and then we pretty much immediately come into turn 12 it's

123
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,840
going to be a very short breaking zone before we actually start to turn the car in and we're

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,000
going to actually trail break as we turn into the corner as well our apex point is going

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,440
to be mid to late in the turn you basically just want to hug that inside curve all the

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,400
way through the corner be careful with it in the dry conditions as a can sometimes unsettle

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,960
the car and obviously avoid it in the wet conditions but when we come out through the exit

128
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,760
we're going to use the exit curve that is out here although there isn't too much space

129
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,800
beyond it so make sure that you don't dip your wheels too far out our out into the gravel

130
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,160
obviously use it in the dry conditions however do avoid it in the wet and rainy conditions

131
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,400
and then we come into the breaking zone for turn 13 again light turn five there's no

132
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,360
real reference point for the breaking zone coming into this corner is literally just

133
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,400
basically judged off of feel and general flow but when we turn the car in we're going

134
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,120
to aim to apex here on the red and white serrated curve which we can use in both the dry

135
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,040
and wet conditions what we need to be careful of is the large sausage curve on the inside

136
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
here we do not want to be clipping that as that will very heavily unsettle the car and

137
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
then when we come out through the exit whilst we want to try and maximize the width of

138
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,680
the track we don't actually want to be running out onto the curb on the outside here so try

139
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
and avoid it in both the dry and wet conditions as what we'll need to do is try and bring the

140
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,880
car back as far right to open up the breaking zone for turns 14 and 15 this is going to

141
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,640
be our breaking point just before we get to the gantry that extends over the circuit we're

142
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,080
going to shift the car down into first gear and turn into the first of the two apexes

143
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,400
for the chicane both of the two apexes should be on the red and white rumble strip curbing

144
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,600
you want to avoid the large red sausage curbs on the inside of both apexes as clipping

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,040
these will bounce and unsettle the car and likely take you off the ideal line that you

146
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,680
want to be taking in order to get through the chicane smoothly coming out 3d exit of

147
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,320
the chicane we got a sun-concerated curb to contend with along with a long yellow sausage

148
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,080
curve that is there in the dry conditions a number of drivers and cars will be able

149
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,520
to take this curve to try and maximize the speed coming off of the corner you want to

150
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,800
avoid it in the wet conditions as the slippery painted surfaces will cost you the traction

151
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,120
and then we come into the final corner itself turns 16 there's no breaking zone for this

152
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,840
corner so it's literally just trying to take a nice smooth line coming through the

153
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,040
turn we're going to clip the apex at midway point we're going to stay off the inside

154
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,640
curve coming through the corners it can potentially unsettle the car in both the dry and also

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,600
the wet conditions and then as we come out 3d exit what to unwind the wheel keep your foot

156
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,720
fully planted maximize the exit curbing out here staying with two wheels on that red

157
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,480
and white serrated curve because extending over that we'll see you infringing track limits

158
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,360
and obviously in the wet conditions you'll probably want to be avoiding this curve pretty

159
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,840
much entirely as it will likely light up the rear tires and then cost you the run to

160
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,800
the start finish line to complete your lap so now that we've done a breakdown of all

161
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,160
the corners let's jump in the car and see how it looks piece together

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,360
so now that we've finished a semi-decent lap around Catalonia I just want to finish off the

163
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,440
episode by saying please be mindful of what your car and car setup is capable of some cars

164
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,200
will be able to break a little bit later than others some cars will be able to take curves better

165
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,400
than others so obviously going to be dependent on your car setup might have a slight factor as

166
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,680
well and then obviously the weather conditions are going to play a factor too obviously I've tried

167
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,200
to highlight these things where possible but please do take note and obviously apply accordingly

168
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,240
to the session race or conditions that you're driving in other than that thank you very much for
