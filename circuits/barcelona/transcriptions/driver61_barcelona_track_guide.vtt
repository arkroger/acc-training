00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Hello everybody, my name is John and welcome to a brand new series on the traction channel.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.600
In this series we'll be working our way through all of the available circuits on a settle

00:12.600 --> 00:17.040
course or competition, helping you find those extra seconds you have been painfully seeking.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.080
For our first edition, we'll be taking a closer look at the circuit to Barcelona Catalonia.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.920
This track is a great place to start, as it's one of the most commonly used in Europe

00:23.920 --> 00:26.120
for all disciplines of high profile motorsport.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.600
It's also a circuit you can find in pretty much any racing game or sim, so it's a good one

00:29.600 --> 00:30.600
to know inside out.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.120
For this video, we have selected the Porsche 911 as it suits the tight and to a signature

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
of the venue well.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.080
Don't forget that if you want to see other car and track combinations, you can subscribe

00:38.080 --> 00:42.080
to the traction channel and hit the notification bell to see them as they're released.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.760
So without further ado, let's jump into the analysis.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.200
So as the lap begins, you have plenty of time to sort yourself out for turn one.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.160
Keep an eye out for the braking markers and the fence and get right up onto the curb

00:54.160 --> 00:57.480
and runoff area on the left hand side before the corner, as long as you keep two wheels

00:57.480 --> 00:59.280
inside the white line.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.200
Take just before the 100 board and change down through all the gears to second.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.000
You can roll off the brake as you approach the apex, just to let the car turn freely,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.320
using the curb on the inside but watching out for the little race block.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.480
Once you get through, grab third gear and slightly feather the throttle as you get through

01:13.480 --> 01:14.480
turn two.

01:14.480 --> 01:18.080
Again, it's a similar situation with the curbs, you want to use the standard curb without

01:18.080 --> 01:19.560
hitting the race block.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.320
Throughout this section, it's mainly a case of modulating your throttle input to keep

01:22.320 --> 01:24.520
the car on the perfect line and well balanced.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.840
If you can, try and stay to the left of the circuit in order to prepare yourself for

01:27.840 --> 01:29.600
the infamous turn three.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.680
As you pass the small section of black runoff that lies between the grass areas on the

01:32.680 --> 01:36.480
left of the circuit, turn in and short shift to fourth, staying on the throttle.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.360
This corner is incredibly long, so don't worry about being a reasonable distance from

01:39.360 --> 01:42.520
the apex of the beginning, it's then a case of rolling off the throttle based on how

01:42.520 --> 01:46.400
much grip you have underneath you, whilst aiming to hit the apex midway through the corner.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.520
Once you get there and ideally kiss the curb on the inside, put your foot down fully

01:49.520 --> 01:51.320
and let the car do the work.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.320
Open up your steering as you head to the corner exit and use all of the room you need in

01:54.320 --> 01:56.080
order to carry maximum speed.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.320
Keep your car way over to the left for turn four.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.240
It might seem mad, but you can use a huge amount of the runoff area in this particular

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
section.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.680
As long as you keep two wheels on the curb, you won't be penalised somehow, so I suggest

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
making the most of it.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.520
Start your braking just before you cross the white strip that runs across the runoff

02:09.520 --> 02:11.480
area, just below the bridge.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.920
You want to trail brake here, turning in and shifting down to second.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.120
As you get closer, you want to roll off the brake, allowing the front of the car to turn

02:18.120 --> 02:19.120
in nicely.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.560
I should emphasise that this technique works well in cars such as the Porsche, Audi or

02:22.560 --> 02:25.280
BMW, but not necessarily every car.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.840
So if you've taken something like a Bentley to Spain, then I can only apologise, you might

02:28.840 --> 02:32.080
need to sacrifice a little bit of lap time and scrub off slightly more speed.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.440
But anyway, as I was saying, you get the nose of the car in and you want to aim to hit

02:35.440 --> 02:38.320
the apex midway through the corner, touching the inside curb.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.080
Get on the power as early as possible and open up your steering.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.440
Just be careful for oversteer here, which could be quite common.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.480
Use as much as the track as you need on the exit whilst keeping it pinned, and quickly

02:46.480 --> 02:49.480
haul yourself back over to the right to prepare for turn five.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.680
It's very tricky to point out a specific reference point here for braking because there

02:52.680 --> 02:54.440
isn't really much to go on.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.520
There's a tower on the left that lines up reasonably well with the ideal braking point,

02:57.520 --> 03:00.680
but if you were looking at that tower whilst approaching the braking zone, you're definitely

03:00.680 --> 03:02.200
doing something wrong.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.880
With this one, it's just a case of practise and getting used to how it feels.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.640
Change down to second and turn in.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.600
With this corner, you want to just miss the inside on the entry in order to cut back.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.680
Get the late apex and get on the power as early as possible.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.920
Use most of the exit curb, just watch out for track limits as always.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.680
You want to stay towards the right hand side through the kink and focus on your entry

03:20.680 --> 03:22.160
into turn seven.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.160
Straight in the car and place it next to the curb.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.200
Just before the curb begins, change down to second and roll off the brake, turning in

03:28.200 --> 03:31.600
early and letting the camber of the corner slow the car down and hold you on that racing

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
line.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.760
At the apex, you want to be fully over the red and white curb, but watch out for the green

03:35.760 --> 03:38.160
area as it can be a bit unpredictable.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.920
Get back on the power at the apex and use the green runoff area on the exit, also cutting

03:41.920 --> 03:44.120
the weak curbs in the direction change.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.520
Stay left and at the end of the entry curbing, lift off the throttle.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.600
You don't actually need to brake here when hot lapping, but might do with a heavy fuel

03:50.600 --> 03:53.720
load and a car that's maybe less suited to these style of corners.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.200
Turn in and use a wee bit of power when required in order to keep the car on the line and

03:57.200 --> 03:58.200
in shape.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.320
Aim to hit the apex midway through the corner, just touching the red and white curb.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.160
Try to carry as much speed as possible and use all of the exit curb and run off.

04:06.160 --> 04:11.760
Drift back to the right and brake comfortably before the 100m boat.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.280
Shift all the way down to first and get over the red and white curbing on the apex.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.360
Get back on the power watching for oversteer and use the exit curb.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.680
For turn 11, some cars can cut more than others.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.800
In this lap, I stuck to the red and white curb and avoided the green section as it can

04:23.800 --> 04:27.440
sometimes throw you off, but see how your car handles it when you try it.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.320
Straighten the steering and get on the brakes instantly, changing down to second.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.760
Try to hold a nice tight line through here, getting on the power nice and early and using

04:34.760 --> 04:36.680
all of the available space on the exit.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.200
Stay out there for turn 13.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.440
Again, there are a lack of reference points here, but this one feels fairly straightforward

04:41.440 --> 04:43.240
when you try it for yourself.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.520
Brake, change down to second and get the car in over the red and white apex curb, avoiding

04:47.520 --> 04:49.640
that sausage curb at all costs.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.560
Straighten the power again and haul the car back to the right.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.440
On this occasion, I was slightly further to the left and therefore was compromised

04:55.440 --> 04:58.800
since the chicane, so try and be even further over if you can.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.200
Again, there aren't many reference points here, but as you can see the corner, it's a

05:02.200 --> 05:04.400
bit easier to judge it based on feel.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.680
Shift down to first and use the inside curbs.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.760
Quickly change direction, short shift and again use the flat section of curbing while on

05:10.760 --> 05:13.320
throttle to optimise your exit speed.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.600
Try and let the yellow sausage curb hold your car online, if you understood over the top

05:16.600 --> 05:19.960
of that curb your car can bottom out and you will lose exit speed and receive a try

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
limits warning.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.800
So just be careful not to put on too much power too soon.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.240
The last corner is simple enough flat out, just make sure you kiss the inside white line

05:27.240 --> 05:30.000
midway through the corner to avoid any understeer.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Use the exit curb and that is a lap of the circuit de Barcelona Catalonia.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.960
Now let's take a look at it in full speed to give you some context as to how it all

07:06.960 --> 07:22.120
looks.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.920
This is the lap time I managed to set in this video, as well as a couple of reference

07:24.920 --> 07:26.640
laps for you guys to aim for.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.640
The AM lap represents a good starting point when you're first learning the circuit, the

07:29.640 --> 07:33.280
Pro AM lap is a good place to be if you're looking to be competitive online, and of course

07:33.280 --> 07:35.680
the Pro lap is for the fastest guys in the world.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.120
Hopefully you've managed to pinpoint a few areas where you can improve your lap times.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.280
When it comes to ACC, always bear in mind that there's a huge amount of variables at

07:42.280 --> 07:44.120
play compared to most games.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.360
Some cars can be up to a second off the pace and a track that doesn't suit them.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.440
Temperatures and track grip levels can also play a big part, so don't worry too much

07:50.440 --> 07:54.000
about your ultimate lap time, just focus on getting each corner right and results will

07:54.000 --> 07:55.920
begin to swing your way.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.120
Just before we finish up, I'm going to attempt to summarise the key points about this circuit

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
in 10 seconds.

08:00.120 --> 08:04.240
You never know, it might just come in handy if you have 35 seconds until your race starts,

08:04.240 --> 08:07.320
but you've done no practice, and you have your YouTube tab open.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.400
Use all this space and entry and roll through to turn one use curves, but not the blocks

08:09.400 --> 08:12.400
focus on late effects to keep the car nicely in line for a turn 3, 4 or 5 car speed and

08:12.400 --> 08:15.160
early for 7 don't break for 9, abuse the curve and for 10 and 11 keep it tight for 12 and

08:15.160 --> 08:18.360
13 smooth to the chicane, wash the high curves and focus on your exit.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.800
Thanks very much for tuning in, and hopefully you enjoyed the video.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.760
