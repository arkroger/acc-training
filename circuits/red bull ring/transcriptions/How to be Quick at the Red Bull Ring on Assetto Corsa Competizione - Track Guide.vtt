00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
So now that traction is well and truly back, how about another Assetto Corsa Competitzione

00:05.200 --> 00:06.200
track guide?

00:06.200 --> 00:09.920
Yes, we've seen all of the comments coming through, asking us to complete the set.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.200
So whilst we continue to get back on our feet, let's start with the easier of the two

00:13.200 --> 00:14.520
remaining circuits.

00:14.520 --> 00:20.240
The Red Bull Ring arrived on ACC in January 2024, as part of the purchasable GT2 DLC

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
pack.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.160
It's a circuit that always produces superb racing, and whilst it might appear an easy

00:25.160 --> 00:30.120
out to master, there is time hidden away in the curves that you might not quite be exploiting.

00:30.120 --> 00:35.080
So here is our traction track guide, using the relatively new Ferrari 296 GT3.

00:35.080 --> 00:40.240
As always, this lap was set in hot lap mode, in relatively cool conditions around 20 degrees.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.360
Use it not as an exact recommendation for how hard to attack every single lap, but as

00:44.360 --> 00:48.040
a way of showing you what might be possible in each corner, and to understand the sorts

00:48.040 --> 00:52.000
of lines and techniques that may well help you extract more lap time than you're currently

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
managing.

00:53.000 --> 01:13.000
This track is all about making the most of the available space, and it's perfectly legal

01:13.000 --> 01:14.720
here to be this far left.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.160
You just need to make sure that any small part of your car is touching the red and white

01:18.160 --> 01:21.840
stripy curve, even if it's just one centimetre of one tire.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.440
Just down to second gear, and don't turn in until just after the 50 board, easing off

01:26.440 --> 01:28.360
the brake pedal as you do turn.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.480
This is where the car can get very unstable, so just be careful not to be too aggressive

01:32.480 --> 01:35.720
with your inputs, and make sure you are rolling off the brake.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.680
Aim to put your right front wheel on the stripy apex curve, but avoid the yellow hump on

01:39.680 --> 01:40.680
the inside.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.320
Hitting this will be disastrous in most car and set up combos, so in a racing situation,

01:45.320 --> 01:48.520
I'd recommend taking a little bit less risk than in a hot lap.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.200
It's all about getting on the power early, and as you can see, I'm already squeezing

01:52.200 --> 01:56.080
the throttle pedal as soon as I turn into the corner, and then I'm on full throttle by

01:56.080 --> 01:57.160
the apex.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.320
This will give you a good run all the way up the hill.

01:59.320 --> 02:03.240
You can carry the speed out of turn one by using all of the extra road available, again,

02:03.240 --> 02:07.400
as long as any of your right side rubber is touching the stripy curve, it's legal, so

02:07.400 --> 02:12.000
you can in fact run your left wheels over the yellow sausage curve as it's fairly flat.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.800
Take the shortest line up the hill, straight lining these subtle curves.

02:15.880 --> 02:20.520
Turn two is a flat out kink to the left, that basically sets up the braking for turn three,

02:20.520 --> 02:22.840
so use this to pull your car fully to the left.

02:22.840 --> 02:27.000
I put my wheels over the white line so that I'm in the perfect spot for braking into turn

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
three.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.960
Again, as long as your inside tires touch the stripy curve, it's legal, so break nice

02:31.960 --> 02:35.520
and light in a straight line all the way over to the left of the road.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.760
Here, I'm stamping on the brake just before the 100 metre line, that steep elevation

02:39.760 --> 02:42.160
will dramatically increase stopping power.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.840
This hairpin is a first gear corner, I wait until I've almost reached the end of the

02:45.840 --> 02:51.240
curve, then I slowly roll off the brake pedal as I turn in, continuing to apply a bit of pressure

02:51.240 --> 02:54.920
just to keep the nose down an optimal grip from the front tires.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.400
Trail braking is an incredibly important technique around here, in fact, nearly every corner

02:59.400 --> 03:01.920
requires it if you want to get a fast lap time.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.120
Every time I say the term rolling off the brake, I essentially mean trail braking, and

03:06.120 --> 03:09.800
if you want to understand what I mean by that exactly and how to do it, check out our

03:09.800 --> 03:12.680
full guide to trail braking via the link on screen now.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.880
It's a similar technique here to turn one, but at a slower speed, of course.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.880
You want to be getting back on the power before you even reach the apex, and that apex

03:20.880 --> 03:24.840
is on the stripy inside curve, but avoiding the yellow hump yet again.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.440
Open out your steering and let the car run out wide on exit so that you can make use of

03:28.440 --> 03:29.840
that early throttle application.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.800
I actually think you can go wider on exit than I did on this lap if you wish, so feel

03:33.800 --> 03:37.560
free to be even earlier than I was on the throttle and run all the way over the yellow

03:37.560 --> 03:39.200
sausage curve to allow this.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.880
As always, it's just about keeping in some small contact with that stripy curve in order

03:43.880 --> 03:45.440
for the lap to remain legal.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.520
I then straight line the next bit on my way towards turn four.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.800
Even though it's also a tight right hander with a left-kink on entry, this one is downhill,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.880
so it feels like a very different corner.

03:54.880 --> 03:59.560
For the third time in three braking zones, use the 100m board as your line of reference,

03:59.560 --> 04:01.400
slowing down just before it.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.760
Positioning is the same as always, all the way over the curve on the left, and trail

04:04.760 --> 04:07.160
braking here is more important than ever.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.240
As you shift down to first, slowly roll off that brake pedal and start turning in before

04:11.240 --> 04:13.640
you approach the end of the curve on the left.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.240
This one with its off camber and downhill nature is very easy to get wrong and run wide,

04:18.240 --> 04:22.280
so I'm turning in fairly early here just to ensure that I make it to the apex curve.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.040
This is probably one of the corners where the aliens will find a couple of tents or so

04:26.040 --> 04:28.080
by opening it out that little bit more.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.960
You can see that I actually go to turn in ever so slightly early, so then make a small

04:31.960 --> 04:35.920
correction and go again, causing me to just miss the apex.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.440
If you can, get up on that curve with your front right.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.120
I'm on the brake pedal all the way to the apex here, leaving it late before getting back

04:42.120 --> 04:46.240
on the power and using all of the available space on exit, right up to the edge of the

04:46.240 --> 04:47.240
gravel trap.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.120
If your car's too loose on exit with the steering in the camber, try short shifting to

04:51.120 --> 04:53.600
second gear for a more stable right.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.560
Head back to the right to minimise the distance through turn 5 and prepare for 6.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.120
It's business as usual with the positioning on entry, all the way over the curve, but

05:01.120 --> 05:02.800
keeping one bit of contact.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.960
At this time, it's a much faster and arguably trickier corner to master.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.200
I start turning in and then braking just before the 50 metre line, being careful to use

05:11.200 --> 05:15.520
slow and smooth inputs in order to avoid unsettling the car on turn in.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.680
Big trail braking is required here, and as I shift down to second, early in the corner

05:19.680 --> 05:24.040
and the engine braking pulls me in further, I'm able to apply that little bit of extra steering

05:24.040 --> 05:27.160
lock to get me in over that stripy apex curve.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.120
It's a long corner, so to maximise it, you really want to be carrying good speed in

05:31.120 --> 05:35.600
and hitting that apex at just the right moment, not too late and not too early.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.480
I'm squeezing the throttle back on just before I get to the apex, and then I'm fully

05:39.480 --> 05:41.320
back on it when I reach it.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.280
You do have to watch for oversteer here though.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.160
The car can step out under full throttle when you cross this curve, so if you want those

05:47.160 --> 05:51.560
fast lap times, you'll need to manage this, or play it a bit safer with either a safer

05:51.560 --> 05:54.120
setup or less throttle in that moment.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.360
Your momentum should carry you all the way out to the exit, and there's no need to worry

05:57.360 --> 06:01.800
about track limits here, just do your best to avoid dipping a wheel over the blue tarmac

06:01.800 --> 06:03.040
and into the gravel.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.120
Stick all the way to the right for turn 7.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.280
Again, I'm turning in for this corner just before I start braking, and just after the

06:09.280 --> 06:10.280
curb ends.

06:10.280 --> 06:14.480
A quick dab of the brakes, staying in third, and then rolling off the brake pedal as I

06:14.480 --> 06:18.680
wind on the steering lock and get all the way over the inside curve, much earlier than

06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
in turn 6.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.680
Get on the power earlier than you think, as it's perfectly legal to run over the teeth

06:23.680 --> 06:27.280
on the exit, so long as you're keeping contact with that stripy curve.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.360
As well as allowing you to carry great exit speed, this line also allows you to shorten

06:31.360 --> 06:35.520
turn 8, as you will already be as far to the inside as you possibly can be without getting

06:35.520 --> 06:36.520
penalised.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.800
That's with all of these tiny margins for track limits, you may want to give yourself

06:39.800 --> 06:42.960
a bit more leeway in the race to avoid picking up penalties.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.120
This just hopefully shows you what can be done and what is allowed to be done if you really

06:47.120 --> 06:48.720
need to on a push lap.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.160
Let the steering wind off as you run to the left on the exit of 8.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.400
Stick to the white line, and get ready to, once again, haul yourself over the curb for

06:56.400 --> 06:58.360
the braking zone into turn 9.

06:58.360 --> 07:03.080
Just before the 50m mark, jump on the brakes and instantly begin heading for the apex, shifting

07:03.080 --> 07:04.080
down to third.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.480
Again, trail braking is key, it's all about balancing your steering input with your

07:08.480 --> 07:12.680
brake pressure to maintain the perfect level of grip needed to make the corner.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.760
You're aiming for your front right wheel to be all the way onto the stripy curve, in fact

07:16.760 --> 07:20.640
on this occasion, get it even further onto the blue netted section.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.440
Get back on the throttle as you reach your apex, and if everything's gone perfectly, you

07:24.440 --> 07:28.080
should naturally run out beyond the stripy curve, and even the teeth.

07:28.080 --> 07:33.320
So long as, you guessed it, you keep contact with the stripy curve, with your inside tires.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.920
I was as close as you can possibly get to the limit on this particular lap.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.560
If there was an equivalent to go line technology or hawk eye, the crowds would probably be

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
gasping.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.480
Unlike previous examples where you kept the car all the way over here, on this occasion,

07:45.480 --> 07:48.840
you're going to need to pull the car back to the right immediately, to avoid bottoming

07:48.840 --> 07:50.720
out as you break for turn 10.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.400
So long as you're right on the far left edge of the teeth, you should be okay.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.480
Get on the brakes hard, just as the additional Austrian flag runoff area ends on the left.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.760
Stay in third, and quickly make your way to the inside, easing off the brake as you aim

08:03.760 --> 08:05.480
for the stripy inside curve.

08:05.480 --> 08:10.040
As always, avoid the yellow hump on the inside, as this is likely to throw your car out white,

08:10.040 --> 08:14.000
and get back on the power as soon as you feel the car drop over the apex curve.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.280
This is such a satisfying corner when you get it right, it feels like the curve hooks

08:17.280 --> 08:19.160
you in and pulls you around.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.320
It just makes it fast and rewarding, allowing you to carry great speed all the way out over

08:23.320 --> 08:26.400
the curve on the outside as you power towards the finish.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.920
Track limits here are the same as everywhere else, keep contact with the stripy curve and

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
you should be fine.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.880
A slight difference here however, is that if you are as wide as you're allowed to be,

08:34.880 --> 08:38.840
you might end up bottoming out a bit and losing both speed and stability, so I really wouldn't

08:38.840 --> 08:43.760
recommend allowing your left front to drift over the high left edge of those teeth.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.920
But that's it, you've completed a fast lap of the red bull ring, so now let's see how

08:47.920 --> 08:49.040
it all flows together.

09:53.320 --> 10:23.280
So there's your lap, a circuit of fine margins, you really do need to push

10:23.280 --> 10:27.360
the boundaries here to find that last second, but as I keep banging on about, if you at

10:27.360 --> 10:30.920
least know where those limits are on a hot lap, you'll be able to better judge just

10:30.920 --> 10:34.040
how much liberty can be taken during a regular race.

10:34.040 --> 10:38.600
I can guarantee you that by simply getting closer to the edges than you were previously,

10:38.600 --> 10:41.880
you will gain free lap time, regardless of nailing the other bits.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.880
So what about lap time targets then?

10:43.880 --> 10:49.400
This lap was a 127.58, but the pros would be looking at high 26s in these sorts of hot

10:49.400 --> 10:54.480
lapping conditions with even more aggressive setups and mid-lap TC and bias adjustments.

10:54.480 --> 10:59.040
If you're getting up to speed as an am, then anything below a 134 is a decent lap time,

10:59.040 --> 11:02.760
whereas those of you looking to compete online should be looking around about the 1 minute

11:02.760 --> 11:03.760
30 mark.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.640
As always, these times are simply set as targets to try and motivate you, please don't

11:07.640 --> 11:10.080
be disheartened if you aren't there yet.

11:10.080 --> 11:15.160
Track conditions, setup, fuel levels all play a huge role in affecting lap time, and I certainly

11:15.160 --> 11:19.160
wouldn't be looking to drop below 28s regularly if I was in a normal session.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.680
The main thing is that you were able to learn something from this video to help you go

11:22.680 --> 11:24.680
faster around the circuit.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.360
Right then, anyone for a 10 second summary?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.320
Eat your turn one from a wide-line wide-ex at wide-line, 3 wide-ex at wide-lines, 4 use

11:30.320 --> 11:33.000

11:33.000 --> 11:35.600
to 7 brush your teeth shock at 8 full eating sign wide-ex at brush your teeth, hang on

11:35.600 --> 11:38.320
through 10 full power wide-ex at brush your teeth again.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.120
