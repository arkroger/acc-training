1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
So now that traction is well and truly back, how about another Assetto Corsa Competitzione

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
track guide?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,920
Yes, we've seen all of the comments coming through, asking us to complete the set.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,200
So whilst we continue to get back on our feet, let's start with the easier of the two

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,520
remaining circuits.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,240
The Red Bull Ring arrived on ACC in January 2024, as part of the purchasable GT2 DLC

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
pack.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,160
It's a circuit that always produces superb racing, and whilst it might appear an easy

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,120
out to master, there is time hidden away in the curves that you might not quite be exploiting.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,080
So here is our traction track guide, using the relatively new Ferrari 296 GT3.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,240
As always, this lap was set in hot lap mode, in relatively cool conditions around 20 degrees.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,360
Use it not as an exact recommendation for how hard to attack every single lap, but as

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,040
a way of showing you what might be possible in each corner, and to understand the sorts

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,000
of lines and techniques that may well help you extract more lap time than you're currently

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
managing.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This track is all about making the most of the available space, and it's perfectly legal

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,720
here to be this far left.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,160
You just need to make sure that any small part of your car is touching the red and white

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,840
stripy curve, even if it's just one centimetre of one tire.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,440
Just down to second gear, and don't turn in until just after the 50 board, easing off

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,360
the brake pedal as you do turn.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,480
This is where the car can get very unstable, so just be careful not to be too aggressive

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,720
with your inputs, and make sure you are rolling off the brake.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,680
Aim to put your right front wheel on the stripy apex curve, but avoid the yellow hump on

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
the inside.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Hitting this will be disastrous in most car and set up combos, so in a racing situation,

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,520
I'd recommend taking a little bit less risk than in a hot lap.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,200
It's all about getting on the power early, and as you can see, I'm already squeezing

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,080
the throttle pedal as soon as I turn into the corner, and then I'm on full throttle by

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
the apex.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,320
This will give you a good run all the way up the hill.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,240
You can carry the speed out of turn one by using all of the extra road available, again,

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,400
as long as any of your right side rubber is touching the stripy curve, it's legal, so

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,000
you can in fact run your left wheels over the yellow sausage curve as it's fairly flat.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Take the shortest line up the hill, straight lining these subtle curves.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Turn two is a flat out kink to the left, that basically sets up the braking for turn three,

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,840
so use this to pull your car fully to the left.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,000
I put my wheels over the white line so that I'm in the perfect spot for braking into turn

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
three.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,960
Again, as long as your inside tires touch the stripy curve, it's legal, so break nice

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,520
and light in a straight line all the way over to the left of the road.

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,760
Here, I'm stamping on the brake just before the 100 metre line, that steep elevation

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
will dramatically increase stopping power.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
This hairpin is a first gear corner, I wait until I've almost reached the end of the

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,240
curve, then I slowly roll off the brake pedal as I turn in, continuing to apply a bit of pressure

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,920
just to keep the nose down an optimal grip from the front tires.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,400
Trail braking is an incredibly important technique around here, in fact, nearly every corner

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
requires it if you want to get a fast lap time.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Every time I say the term rolling off the brake, I essentially mean trail braking, and

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,800
if you want to understand what I mean by that exactly and how to do it, check out our

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,680
full guide to trail braking via the link on screen now.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,880
It's a similar technique here to turn one, but at a slower speed, of course.

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,880
You want to be getting back on the power before you even reach the apex, and that apex

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,840
is on the stripy inside curve, but avoiding the yellow hump yet again.

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Open out your steering and let the car run out wide on exit so that you can make use of

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,840
that early throttle application.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,800
I actually think you can go wider on exit than I did on this lap if you wish, so feel

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,560
free to be even earlier than I was on the throttle and run all the way over the yellow

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,200
sausage curve to allow this.

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,880
As always, it's just about keeping in some small contact with that stripy curve in order

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,440
for the lap to remain legal.

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,520
I then straight line the next bit on my way towards turn four.

63
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,800
Even though it's also a tight right hander with a left-kink on entry, this one is downhill,

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,880
so it feels like a very different corner.

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,560
For the third time in three braking zones, use the 100m board as your line of reference,

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,400
slowing down just before it.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,760
Positioning is the same as always, all the way over the curve on the left, and trail

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,160
braking here is more important than ever.

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,240
As you shift down to first, slowly roll off that brake pedal and start turning in before

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,640
you approach the end of the curve on the left.

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,240
This one with its off camber and downhill nature is very easy to get wrong and run wide,

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,280
so I'm turning in fairly early here just to ensure that I make it to the apex curve.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,040
This is probably one of the corners where the aliens will find a couple of tents or so

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,080
by opening it out that little bit more.

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,960
You can see that I actually go to turn in ever so slightly early, so then make a small

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,920
correction and go again, causing me to just miss the apex.

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
If you can, get up on that curve with your front right.

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm on the brake pedal all the way to the apex here, leaving it late before getting back

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,240
on the power and using all of the available space on exit, right up to the edge of the

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
gravel trap.

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,120
If your car's too loose on exit with the steering in the camber, try short shifting to

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
second gear for a more stable right.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Head back to the right to minimise the distance through turn 5 and prepare for 6.

84
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,120
It's business as usual with the positioning on entry, all the way over the curve, but

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
keeping one bit of contact.

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
At this time, it's a much faster and arguably trickier corner to master.

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,200
I start turning in and then braking just before the 50 metre line, being careful to use

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,520
slow and smooth inputs in order to avoid unsettling the car on turn in.

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,680
Big trail braking is required here, and as I shift down to second, early in the corner

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,040
and the engine braking pulls me in further, I'm able to apply that little bit of extra steering

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,160
lock to get me in over that stripy apex curve.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,120
It's a long corner, so to maximise it, you really want to be carrying good speed in

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
and hitting that apex at just the right moment, not too late and not too early.

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm squeezing the throttle back on just before I get to the apex, and then I'm fully

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,320
back on it when I reach it.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,280
You do have to watch for oversteer here though.

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,160
The car can step out under full throttle when you cross this curve, so if you want those

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,560
fast lap times, you'll need to manage this, or play it a bit safer with either a safer

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,120
setup or less throttle in that moment.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
Your momentum should carry you all the way out to the exit, and there's no need to worry

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,800
about track limits here, just do your best to avoid dipping a wheel over the blue tarmac

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
and into the gravel.

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Stick all the way to the right for turn 7.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Again, I'm turning in for this corner just before I start braking, and just after the

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
curb ends.

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,480
A quick dab of the brakes, staying in third, and then rolling off the brake pedal as I

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,680
wind on the steering lock and get all the way over the inside curve, much earlier than

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
in turn 6.

109
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Get on the power earlier than you think, as it's perfectly legal to run over the teeth

110
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
on the exit, so long as you're keeping contact with that stripy curve.

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,360
As well as allowing you to carry great exit speed, this line also allows you to shorten

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
turn 8, as you will already be as far to the inside as you possibly can be without getting

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
penalised.

114
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,800
That's with all of these tiny margins for track limits, you may want to give yourself

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,960
a bit more leeway in the race to avoid picking up penalties.

116
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
This just hopefully shows you what can be done and what is allowed to be done if you really

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
need to on a push lap.

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
Let the steering wind off as you run to the left on the exit of 8.

119
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
Stick to the white line, and get ready to, once again, haul yourself over the curb for

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,360
the braking zone into turn 9.

121
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,080
Just before the 50m mark, jump on the brakes and instantly begin heading for the apex, shifting

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
down to third.

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,480
Again, trail braking is key, it's all about balancing your steering input with your

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,680
brake pressure to maintain the perfect level of grip needed to make the corner.

125
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,760
You're aiming for your front right wheel to be all the way onto the stripy curve, in fact

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,640
on this occasion, get it even further onto the blue netted section.

127
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Get back on the throttle as you reach your apex, and if everything's gone perfectly, you

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,080
should naturally run out beyond the stripy curve, and even the teeth.

129
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,320
So long as, you guessed it, you keep contact with the stripy curve, with your inside tires.

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,920
I was as close as you can possibly get to the limit on this particular lap.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,560
If there was an equivalent to go line technology or hawk eye, the crowds would probably be

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
gasping.

133
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,480
Unlike previous examples where you kept the car all the way over here, on this occasion,

134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840
you're going to need to pull the car back to the right immediately, to avoid bottoming

135
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
out as you break for turn 10.

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
So long as you're right on the far left edge of the teeth, you should be okay.

137
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Get on the brakes hard, just as the additional Austrian flag runoff area ends on the left.

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Stay in third, and quickly make your way to the inside, easing off the brake as you aim

139
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,480
for the stripy inside curve.

140
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,040
As always, avoid the yellow hump on the inside, as this is likely to throw your car out white,

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,000
and get back on the power as soon as you feel the car drop over the apex curve.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
This is such a satisfying corner when you get it right, it feels like the curve hooks

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,160
you in and pulls you around.

144
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,320
It just makes it fast and rewarding, allowing you to carry great speed all the way out over

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,400
the curve on the outside as you power towards the finish.

146
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,920
Track limits here are the same as everywhere else, keep contact with the stripy curve and

147
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
you should be fine.

148
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,880
A slight difference here however, is that if you are as wide as you're allowed to be,

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,840
you might end up bottoming out a bit and losing both speed and stability, so I really wouldn't

150
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,760
recommend allowing your left front to drift over the high left edge of those teeth.

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,920
But that's it, you've completed a fast lap of the red bull ring, so now let's see how

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
it all flows together.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:23,280
So there's your lap, a circuit of fine margins, you really do need to push

154
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,360
the boundaries here to find that last second, but as I keep banging on about, if you at

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,920
least know where those limits are on a hot lap, you'll be able to better judge just

156
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,040
how much liberty can be taken during a regular race.

157
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,600
I can guarantee you that by simply getting closer to the edges than you were previously,

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,880
you will gain free lap time, regardless of nailing the other bits.

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
So what about lap time targets then?

160
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,400
This lap was a 127.58, but the pros would be looking at high 26s in these sorts of hot

161
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,480
lapping conditions with even more aggressive setups and mid-lap TC and bias adjustments.

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,040
If you're getting up to speed as an am, then anything below a 134 is a decent lap time,

163
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,760
whereas those of you looking to compete online should be looking around about the 1 minute

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
30 mark.

165
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,640
As always, these times are simply set as targets to try and motivate you, please don't

166
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,080
be disheartened if you aren't there yet.

167
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,160
Track conditions, setup, fuel levels all play a huge role in affecting lap time, and I certainly

168
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,160
wouldn't be looking to drop below 28s regularly if I was in a normal session.

169
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,680
The main thing is that you were able to learn something from this video to help you go

170
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
faster around the circuit.

171
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,360
Right then, anyone for a 10 second summary?

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
Eat your turn one from a wide-line wide-ex at wide-line, 3 wide-ex at wide-lines, 4 use

173

176
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,120
Thanks as always for watching, and don't forget to grab your setups from the description.
