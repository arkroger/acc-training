4720	8080	track guide series for a setter course of competition.
8080	12320	In today's episode we'll be taking a look at the Red Bull Ring which came with the GT2
12320	13320	DLC pack.
13320	17040	We'll be breaking down each individual corner giving you all the knowledge and tips that
17040	20000	you need in order to help improve your lap times.

29120	32920	The Red Bull Ring could be found in the stereo and mountains of Austria and has a circuit
32920	37360	length of 2.68 miles which equates to 4.32 km.
37360	42920	The track features 10 corners with a medium to hide down for setup and soft to medium suspension.
42920	48120	Your key overtaking spots are going to be turns 1, turn 3, turn 4 and turn 6.
48120	51680	The pit entry can be found after the second to last turn on the right hand side of the
51680	52680	circuit.
52680	55720	You will need to break slightly on the pit entry slip road in order to make that right
55720	60240	handle on the inside of the pit entry barrier and then again slow down just before you get
60240	64920	to the gantry in order to make it to the pit speed limiter line at the appropriate speed.
64920	68440	The pit exit line is just after the traffic lights at the end of the pit lane disengaged
68440	72360	limiter here accelerate out the pit lane and once again you'll need to slow for the right
72360	76560	handle on the inside of turn 1 here in order to avoid clipping the wall and damaging the
76560	77560	car.
77560	80320	Make sure you stay to the right of the pit exit merge line as you then accelerate up
80320	82040	towards turns 2 and 3.
82040	85720	The braking zone for turn 1 starts at the 100 meter board however some cars may allow
85720	88120	you to brake marginally later than this.
88120	91600	You want to be straddling this curb on the left hand side as much as you possibly can to
91600	96120	open up that first turn getting hard on the brake shifting the car down into second gear.
96120	100360	Our apex is going to be mid way through the corner brushing our inside right hand
100360	104320	wheels on the red and white curbing that is here at the apex.
104320	107680	It's absolutely crucial that you avoid the yellow sausage curb there on the inside because
107680	111000	it will bounce unsaturated the car and completely ruin your exit.
111000	114720	Get the car straight end up and get hard on the power as soon as you possibly can because
114720	118040	getting a good run off of this corner is going to be absolutely crucial leading onto
118040	120240	the longest straight on the circuit.
120240	123360	Providing you keep two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing you should remain
123360	127480	within track limits so don't be afraid to go over and straddle that yellow sausage
127480	131120	curbing that is there on the outside in the dry conditions it's not going to unsettle
131120	135120	the car too much and it's going to allow you to carry a higher apex speed in the wet
135120	139160	conditions however you want to be staying off of this curbing in order to avoid losing
139160	140160	any traction.
140240	143480	Turn 2 is barely a corner that we even need to worry about so we're now into the braking
143480	144760	zone for turn 3.
144760	148640	Despite the higher speeds we can still brake at 100m board and make the corner due to
148640	151200	the uphill slope on the approach to the corner.
151200	154440	Try and straddle as much of the curve as you possibly can on the left hand side of the
154440	158480	track here in order to open up the turn, shift the car all the way down into first gear
158480	161360	and aim to hook up a mid to late apex.
161360	164440	You don't necessarily need to touch the curve here on the inside you just want to be getting
164440	168640	as close to it as possible and focus on straightening up the car for the exit.
168640	172160	You once again want to be avoiding that yellow such as curb that's there on the inside
172160	175160	of the corner and you want to be picking up the throttle just before you actually reach
175160	176840	this apex point.
176840	179960	Focus on trying to keep the car straight as possible and managing that traction don't
179960	184280	be afraid to use the curbing here on the outside once again making sure that you keep at
184280	188760	least two wheels on the red and white curbing in order to stay within track limits.
188760	192640	As this is a crucial traction zone in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid
192640	194200	the curbing entirely.
194200	197800	Full turn 4 will once again be braking at the 100m board and will be getting as far
197800	201880	left as we possibly can, strolling that red and white curbing that's there on the outside
201880	203760	on the approach to the corner.
203760	207840	Turn in reasonably late with a nice flowing arc through the turn and hook up a mid to late
207840	208840	apex.
208840	212120	You're going to be in either first or second gear depending on your car's gear ratios.
212120	215960	So slight bit of camber here, the curbing is flat here on the inside so make sure to
215960	219920	get your right hand wheels up over that curbing in the dry conditions however do take caution
219920	223600	with it in the wet as you start to pick up throttle and continue through the turn it may
223600	226360	cause oversteer whilst up on that curb.
226360	229600	Before the exit we again want to be managing the power and getting a good translation
229600	234080	of traction as we drive off of the corner, we've got just beyond the red and white serrated
234080	237960	curbing a blue painted tarmac strip with gravel beyond it.
237960	242480	Use the curb and that bit of tarmac in the dry conditions of see avoid dipping your wheels
242480	246400	into the gravel as that will hurt your momentum off the turn and then in the wet conditions
246400	249960	you want to stay clear of both in order to give yourself the best drive off the turn you
249960	251360	possibly can.
251360	255640	Turn 5 is effectively a continuation of the turn 4 exit so we're now into the braking
255640	257120	zone of turn 6.
257120	260480	Place the car as far right as you possibly can over the red and white serrated curbing
260480	264400	on the right hand side of the track here break at a 50 meter board and immediately start
264400	267000	going in the car in towards the inside of the corner.
267000	270600	We're going to be looking to apex midway through the turn in second or third gear depending
270600	274640	on the car's gear ratios, it's a smooth flat curb with some grass creep there on the
274640	279760	inside feel free to use this in the dry conditions and progressively pick up the throttle do take
279760	283160	caution with it in the wet as it may cause some oversteer.
283160	286480	From the outside of the corner we've got a serrated curve with blue painted tarmac and
286480	290880	gravel beyond it make sure to use this available runoff towards you providing you don't dip
290880	294240	the wheels into the gravel track limits is not going to be an issue you're going to be
294240	298360	running into the gravel and hurting your momentum before you breach those but as always
298360	302320	stay clear of the painted tarmac and that red and white curbing on the exit in those
302320	304440	wetter rainy conditions.
304440	307760	Keep the car as far right over the curbing and that painted tarmac strip as you possibly
307760	312000	can and then just as the gravel ends on the approach to turn 7 that is when we're going
312000	316080	to get onto the brakes is going to be a short gentle squeeze on those brakes as we once
316080	320800	again guide the car into a mid corner apex will be in second or third gear depending on
320800	325640	the car's gear ratios curbing is exactly the same as it was on the previous corner smooth
325640	330080	flat with some grass creep there on the inside get your left wheels up on this as much as
330080	334880	you can in the dry conditions however do take caution with it in the wet.
334880	338440	Feed the power in fairly aggressively and let the car go way out onto the curbing on the
338440	343040	exit of turn 7 here which immediately feeds into turn 8 the two are pretty much connected
343040	344040	together.
344040	347240	Keep the left wheels of the car on that red and white serrated curbing in order to avoid
347240	351160	reaching track limits and keep the right hand of wheels out of the gravel.
351160	355560	In the wet and rainy conditions you'll be wanted to stay clear of this curbing entirely.
355560	359120	Coming into turn 9 the penultimate corner we once again want to be putting our car
359120	363400	as far over the left hand side as we possibly can over that red and white curbing break
363400	367240	out the 50 meter board and immediately start turning the car in shifting the car down
367320	370640	into third gear and hooking up a mid corner apex.
370640	374720	Get the inside tyres up over the curbing and on the grass creep on the inside do this
374720	377400	in both the dry and wet conditions.
377400	381040	Try to be confident on the exit get punchy with the throttle and let the car run out
381040	383760	wide making use of that runoff area.
383760	387440	Make sure that you keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay
387440	391960	within track limits and in the wetter and more slippery conditions be cautious running
391960	395760	out wide over this curbing here probably avoid it entirely.
395760	399240	From the approach to the final corner you'll still be on that exit curbing bring the
399240	403120	car back so the left hand wheels are on it not the entire car because once you get to
403120	408480	the breaking point at the end of the red and white painted tarmac runoff area the floor
408480	411880	and spitter of the car will bottom out on that serrated curbing so make sure it's just
411880	415680	your wheels that are on it drop the car down into second gear and make sure you apex
415680	416920	make corner.
416920	420320	Unlike previous corners at this circuit you should be able to hammer that inside yellow
420320	424680	sausage curve and you should be able to do this in both the dry and wet conditions.
424680	428800	Hard on the throttle as soon as we hit out apex let the car run out wide and make use
428800	430960	of the available runoff to you.
430960	435240	Keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay within track limits
435240	439200	and for the wetter conditions you'll want to stay away from the curbing entirely.
439200	442760	With the breakdown of each corner complete let's go ahead and piece it all together with
442760	458760	a demonstration lap.
518760	543960	With this go complete I just want to highlight down in description below are my track titan
543960	567560	affiliate links.
567560	571160	If you do pick up track titan make sure to compare yourself against my lap that is here
571160	576720	in the guide just search for yorki065 in the community tab of the reference lap time.
576720	581360	I hope both that and this guide have been useful to you leave a like if so let us know
