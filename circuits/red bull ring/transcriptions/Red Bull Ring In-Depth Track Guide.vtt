00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Hey guys, it's Yogi here and welcome to the channel for episode 24 of the in-depth

00:04.720 --> 00:08.080
track guide series for a setter course of competition.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.320
In today's episode we'll be taking a look at the Red Bull Ring which came with the GT2

00:12.320 --> 00:13.320
DLC pack.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.040
We'll be breaking down each individual corner giving you all the knowledge and tips that

00:17.040 --> 00:20.000
you need in order to help improve your lap times.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.040

00:29.120 --> 00:32.920
The Red Bull Ring could be found in the stereo and mountains of Austria and has a circuit

00:32.920 --> 00:37.360
length of 2.68 miles which equates to 4.32 km.

00:37.360 --> 00:42.920
The track features 10 corners with a medium to hide down for setup and soft to medium suspension.

00:42.920 --> 00:48.120
Your key overtaking spots are going to be turns 1, turn 3, turn 4 and turn 6.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.680
The pit entry can be found after the second to last turn on the right hand side of the

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
circuit.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.720
You will need to break slightly on the pit entry slip road in order to make that right

00:55.720 --> 01:00.240
handle on the inside of the pit entry barrier and then again slow down just before you get

01:00.240 --> 01:04.920
to the gantry in order to make it to the pit speed limiter line at the appropriate speed.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.440
The pit exit line is just after the traffic lights at the end of the pit lane disengaged

01:08.440 --> 01:12.360
limiter here accelerate out the pit lane and once again you'll need to slow for the right

01:12.360 --> 01:16.560
handle on the inside of turn 1 here in order to avoid clipping the wall and damaging the

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
car.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.320
Make sure you stay to the right of the pit exit merge line as you then accelerate up

01:20.320 --> 01:22.040
towards turns 2 and 3.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.720
The braking zone for turn 1 starts at the 100 meter board however some cars may allow

01:25.720 --> 01:28.120
you to brake marginally later than this.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.600
You want to be straddling this curb on the left hand side as much as you possibly can to

01:31.600 --> 01:36.120
open up that first turn getting hard on the brake shifting the car down into second gear.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.360
Our apex is going to be mid way through the corner brushing our inside right hand

01:40.360 --> 01:44.320
wheels on the red and white curbing that is here at the apex.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.680
It's absolutely crucial that you avoid the yellow sausage curb there on the inside because

01:47.680 --> 01:51.000
it will bounce unsaturated the car and completely ruin your exit.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.720
Get the car straight end up and get hard on the power as soon as you possibly can because

01:54.720 --> 01:58.040
getting a good run off of this corner is going to be absolutely crucial leading onto

01:58.040 --> 02:00.240
the longest straight on the circuit.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.360
Providing you keep two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing you should remain

02:03.360 --> 02:07.480
within track limits so don't be afraid to go over and straddle that yellow sausage

02:07.480 --> 02:11.120
curbing that is there on the outside in the dry conditions it's not going to unsettle

02:11.120 --> 02:15.120
the car too much and it's going to allow you to carry a higher apex speed in the wet

02:15.120 --> 02:19.160
conditions however you want to be staying off of this curbing in order to avoid losing

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
any traction.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.480
Turn 2 is barely a corner that we even need to worry about so we're now into the braking

02:23.480 --> 02:24.760
zone for turn 3.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.640
Despite the higher speeds we can still brake at 100m board and make the corner due to

02:28.640 --> 02:31.200
the uphill slope on the approach to the corner.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.440
Try and straddle as much of the curve as you possibly can on the left hand side of the

02:34.440 --> 02:38.480
track here in order to open up the turn, shift the car all the way down into first gear

02:38.480 --> 02:41.360
and aim to hook up a mid to late apex.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.440
You don't necessarily need to touch the curve here on the inside you just want to be getting

02:44.440 --> 02:48.640
as close to it as possible and focus on straightening up the car for the exit.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.160
You once again want to be avoiding that yellow such as curb that's there on the inside

02:52.160 --> 02:55.160
of the corner and you want to be picking up the throttle just before you actually reach

02:55.160 --> 02:56.840
this apex point.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.960
Focus on trying to keep the car straight as possible and managing that traction don't

02:59.960 --> 03:04.280
be afraid to use the curbing here on the outside once again making sure that you keep at

03:04.280 --> 03:08.760
least two wheels on the red and white curbing in order to stay within track limits.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.640
As this is a crucial traction zone in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid

03:12.640 --> 03:14.200
the curbing entirely.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.800
Full turn 4 will once again be braking at the 100m board and will be getting as far

03:17.800 --> 03:21.880
left as we possibly can, strolling that red and white curbing that's there on the outside

03:21.880 --> 03:23.760
on the approach to the corner.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.840
Turn in reasonably late with a nice flowing arc through the turn and hook up a mid to late

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
apex.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.120
You're going to be in either first or second gear depending on your car's gear ratios.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.960
So slight bit of camber here, the curbing is flat here on the inside so make sure to

03:35.960 --> 03:39.920
get your right hand wheels up over that curbing in the dry conditions however do take caution

03:39.920 --> 03:43.600
with it in the wet as you start to pick up throttle and continue through the turn it may

03:43.600 --> 03:46.360
cause oversteer whilst up on that curb.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.600
Before the exit we again want to be managing the power and getting a good translation

03:49.600 --> 03:54.080
of traction as we drive off of the corner, we've got just beyond the red and white serrated

03:54.080 --> 03:57.960
curbing a blue painted tarmac strip with gravel beyond it.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.480
Use the curb and that bit of tarmac in the dry conditions of see avoid dipping your wheels

04:02.480 --> 04:06.400
into the gravel as that will hurt your momentum off the turn and then in the wet conditions

04:06.400 --> 04:09.960
you want to stay clear of both in order to give yourself the best drive off the turn you

04:09.960 --> 04:11.360
possibly can.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.640
Turn 5 is effectively a continuation of the turn 4 exit so we're now into the braking

04:15.640 --> 04:17.120
zone of turn 6.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.480
Place the car as far right as you possibly can over the red and white serrated curbing

04:20.480 --> 04:24.400
on the right hand side of the track here break at a 50 meter board and immediately start

04:24.400 --> 04:27.000
going in the car in towards the inside of the corner.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.600
We're going to be looking to apex midway through the turn in second or third gear depending

04:30.600 --> 04:34.640
on the car's gear ratios, it's a smooth flat curb with some grass creep there on the

04:34.640 --> 04:39.760
inside feel free to use this in the dry conditions and progressively pick up the throttle do take

04:39.760 --> 04:43.160
caution with it in the wet as it may cause some oversteer.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.480
From the outside of the corner we've got a serrated curve with blue painted tarmac and

04:46.480 --> 04:50.880
gravel beyond it make sure to use this available runoff towards you providing you don't dip

04:50.880 --> 04:54.240
the wheels into the gravel track limits is not going to be an issue you're going to be

04:54.240 --> 04:58.360
running into the gravel and hurting your momentum before you breach those but as always

04:58.360 --> 05:02.320
stay clear of the painted tarmac and that red and white curbing on the exit in those

05:02.320 --> 05:04.440
wetter rainy conditions.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.760
Keep the car as far right over the curbing and that painted tarmac strip as you possibly

05:07.760 --> 05:12.000
can and then just as the gravel ends on the approach to turn 7 that is when we're going

05:12.000 --> 05:16.080
to get onto the brakes is going to be a short gentle squeeze on those brakes as we once

05:16.080 --> 05:20.800
again guide the car into a mid corner apex will be in second or third gear depending on

05:20.800 --> 05:25.640
the car's gear ratios curbing is exactly the same as it was on the previous corner smooth

05:25.640 --> 05:30.080
flat with some grass creep there on the inside get your left wheels up on this as much as

05:30.080 --> 05:34.880
you can in the dry conditions however do take caution with it in the wet.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.440
Feed the power in fairly aggressively and let the car go way out onto the curbing on the

05:38.440 --> 05:43.040
exit of turn 7 here which immediately feeds into turn 8 the two are pretty much connected

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
together.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.240
Keep the left wheels of the car on that red and white serrated curbing in order to avoid

05:47.240 --> 05:51.160
reaching track limits and keep the right hand of wheels out of the gravel.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.560
In the wet and rainy conditions you'll be wanted to stay clear of this curbing entirely.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.120
Coming into turn 9 the penultimate corner we once again want to be putting our car

05:59.120 --> 06:03.400
as far over the left hand side as we possibly can over that red and white curbing break

06:03.400 --> 06:07.240
out the 50 meter board and immediately start turning the car in shifting the car down

06:07.320 --> 06:10.640
into third gear and hooking up a mid corner apex.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.720
Get the inside tyres up over the curbing and on the grass creep on the inside do this

06:14.720 --> 06:17.400
in both the dry and wet conditions.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.040
Try to be confident on the exit get punchy with the throttle and let the car run out

06:21.040 --> 06:23.760
wide making use of that runoff area.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.440
Make sure that you keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay

06:27.440 --> 06:31.960
within track limits and in the wetter and more slippery conditions be cautious running

06:31.960 --> 06:35.760
out wide over this curbing here probably avoid it entirely.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.240
From the approach to the final corner you'll still be on that exit curbing bring the

06:39.240 --> 06:43.120
car back so the left hand wheels are on it not the entire car because once you get to

06:43.120 --> 06:48.480
the breaking point at the end of the red and white painted tarmac runoff area the floor

06:48.480 --> 06:51.880
and spitter of the car will bottom out on that serrated curbing so make sure it's just

06:51.880 --> 06:55.680
your wheels that are on it drop the car down into second gear and make sure you apex

06:55.680 --> 06:56.920
make corner.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.320
Unlike previous corners at this circuit you should be able to hammer that inside yellow

07:00.320 --> 07:04.680
sausage curve and you should be able to do this in both the dry and wet conditions.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.800
Hard on the throttle as soon as we hit out apex let the car run out wide and make use

07:08.800 --> 07:10.960
of the available runoff to you.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.240
Keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay within track limits

07:15.240 --> 07:19.200
and for the wetter conditions you'll want to stay away from the curbing entirely.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.760
With the breakdown of each corner complete let's go ahead and piece it all together with

07:22.760 --> 07:38.760
a demonstration lap.

08:38.760 --> 09:03.960
With this go complete I just want to highlight down in description below are my track titan

09:03.960 --> 09:27.560

09:27.560 --> 09:31.160
If you do pick up track titan make sure to compare yourself against my lap that is here

09:31.160 --> 09:36.720
in the guide just search for yorki065 in the community tab of the reference lap time.

09:36.720 --> 09:41.360
I hope both that and this guide have been useful to you leave a like if so let us know

09:41.360 --> 09:45.880
