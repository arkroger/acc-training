0	5200	So now that traction is well and truly back, how about another Assetto Corsa Competitzione
5200	6200	track guide?
6200	9920	Yes, we've seen all of the comments coming through, asking us to complete the set.
9920	13200	So whilst we continue to get back on our feet, let's start with the easier of the two
13200	14520	remaining circuits.
14520	20240	The Red Bull Ring arrived on ACC in January 2024, as part of the purchasable GT2 DLC
20240	21240	pack.
21240	25160	It's a circuit that always produces superb racing, and whilst it might appear an easy
25160	30120	out to master, there is time hidden away in the curves that you might not quite be exploiting.
30120	35080	So here is our traction track guide, using the relatively new Ferrari 296 GT3.
35080	40240	As always, this lap was set in hot lap mode, in relatively cool conditions around 20 degrees.
40240	44360	Use it not as an exact recommendation for how hard to attack every single lap, but as
44360	48040	a way of showing you what might be possible in each corner, and to understand the sorts
48040	52000	of lines and techniques that may well help you extract more lap time than you're currently
52000	53000	managing.
53000	73000	This track is all about making the most of the available space, and it's perfectly legal
73000	74720	here to be this far left.
74720	78160	You just need to make sure that any small part of your car is touching the red and white
78160	81840	stripy curve, even if it's just one centimetre of one tire.
81840	86440	Just down to second gear, and don't turn in until just after the 50 board, easing off
86440	88360	the brake pedal as you do turn.
88360	92480	This is where the car can get very unstable, so just be careful not to be too aggressive
92480	95720	with your inputs, and make sure you are rolling off the brake.
95720	99680	Aim to put your right front wheel on the stripy apex curve, but avoid the yellow hump on
99680	100680	the inside.
100680	105320	Hitting this will be disastrous in most car and set up combos, so in a racing situation,
105320	108520	I'd recommend taking a little bit less risk than in a hot lap.
108520	112200	It's all about getting on the power early, and as you can see, I'm already squeezing
112200	116080	the throttle pedal as soon as I turn into the corner, and then I'm on full throttle by
116080	117160	the apex.
117160	119320	This will give you a good run all the way up the hill.
119320	123240	You can carry the speed out of turn one by using all of the extra road available, again,
123240	127400	as long as any of your right side rubber is touching the stripy curve, it's legal, so
127400	132000	you can in fact run your left wheels over the yellow sausage curve as it's fairly flat.
132000	135800	Take the shortest line up the hill, straight lining these subtle curves.
135880	140520	Turn two is a flat out kink to the left, that basically sets up the braking for turn three,
140520	142840	so use this to pull your car fully to the left.
142840	147000	I put my wheels over the white line so that I'm in the perfect spot for braking into turn
147000	148000	three.
148000	151960	Again, as long as your inside tires touch the stripy curve, it's legal, so break nice
151960	155520	and light in a straight line all the way over to the left of the road.
155520	159760	Here, I'm stamping on the brake just before the 100 metre line, that steep elevation
159760	162160	will dramatically increase stopping power.
162160	165840	This hairpin is a first gear corner, I wait until I've almost reached the end of the
165840	171240	curve, then I slowly roll off the brake pedal as I turn in, continuing to apply a bit of pressure
171240	174920	just to keep the nose down an optimal grip from the front tires.
174920	179400	Trail braking is an incredibly important technique around here, in fact, nearly every corner
179400	181920	requires it if you want to get a fast lap time.
181920	186120	Every time I say the term rolling off the brake, I essentially mean trail braking, and
186120	189800	if you want to understand what I mean by that exactly and how to do it, check out our
189800	192680	full guide to trail braking via the link on screen now.
192680	196880	It's a similar technique here to turn one, but at a slower speed, of course.
196880	200880	You want to be getting back on the power before you even reach the apex, and that apex
200880	204840	is on the stripy inside curve, but avoiding the yellow hump yet again.
204840	208440	Open out your steering and let the car run out wide on exit so that you can make use of
208440	209840	that early throttle application.
209840	213800	I actually think you can go wider on exit than I did on this lap if you wish, so feel
213800	217560	free to be even earlier than I was on the throttle and run all the way over the yellow
217560	219200	sausage curve to allow this.
219200	223880	As always, it's just about keeping in some small contact with that stripy curve in order
223880	225440	for the lap to remain legal.
225440	228520	I then straight line the next bit on my way towards turn four.
228520	232800	Even though it's also a tight right hander with a left-kink on entry, this one is downhill,
232800	234880	so it feels like a very different corner.
234880	239560	For the third time in three braking zones, use the 100m board as your line of reference,
239560	241400	slowing down just before it.
241400	244760	Positioning is the same as always, all the way over the curve on the left, and trail
244760	247160	braking here is more important than ever.
247160	251240	As you shift down to first, slowly roll off that brake pedal and start turning in before
251240	253640	you approach the end of the curve on the left.
253640	258240	This one with its off camber and downhill nature is very easy to get wrong and run wide,
258240	262280	so I'm turning in fairly early here just to ensure that I make it to the apex curve.
262280	266040	This is probably one of the corners where the aliens will find a couple of tents or so
266040	268080	by opening it out that little bit more.
268080	271960	You can see that I actually go to turn in ever so slightly early, so then make a small
271960	275920	correction and go again, causing me to just miss the apex.
275920	278440	If you can, get up on that curve with your front right.
278440	282120	I'm on the brake pedal all the way to the apex here, leaving it late before getting back
282120	286240	on the power and using all of the available space on exit, right up to the edge of the
286240	287240	gravel trap.
287240	291120	If your car's too loose on exit with the steering in the camber, try short shifting to
291120	293600	second gear for a more stable right.
293600	297560	Head back to the right to minimise the distance through turn 5 and prepare for 6.
297560	301120	It's business as usual with the positioning on entry, all the way over the curve, but
301120	302800	keeping one bit of contact.
302800	306960	At this time, it's a much faster and arguably trickier corner to master.
306960	311200	I start turning in and then braking just before the 50 metre line, being careful to use
311200	315520	slow and smooth inputs in order to avoid unsettling the car on turn in.
315520	319680	Big trail braking is required here, and as I shift down to second, early in the corner
319680	324040	and the engine braking pulls me in further, I'm able to apply that little bit of extra steering
324040	327160	lock to get me in over that stripy apex curve.
327160	331120	It's a long corner, so to maximise it, you really want to be carrying good speed in
331120	335600	and hitting that apex at just the right moment, not too late and not too early.
335600	339480	I'm squeezing the throttle back on just before I get to the apex, and then I'm fully
339480	341320	back on it when I reach it.
341320	343280	You do have to watch for oversteer here though.
343280	347160	The car can step out under full throttle when you cross this curve, so if you want those
347160	351560	fast lap times, you'll need to manage this, or play it a bit safer with either a safer
351560	354120	setup or less throttle in that moment.
354120	357360	Your momentum should carry you all the way out to the exit, and there's no need to worry
357360	361800	about track limits here, just do your best to avoid dipping a wheel over the blue tarmac
361800	363040	and into the gravel.
363040	365120	Stick all the way to the right for turn 7.
365120	369280	Again, I'm turning in for this corner just before I start braking, and just after the
369280	370280	curb ends.
370280	374480	A quick dab of the brakes, staying in third, and then rolling off the brake pedal as I
374480	378680	wind on the steering lock and get all the way over the inside curve, much earlier than
378680	379680	in turn 6.
379680	383680	Get on the power earlier than you think, as it's perfectly legal to run over the teeth
383680	387280	on the exit, so long as you're keeping contact with that stripy curve.
387280	391360	As well as allowing you to carry great exit speed, this line also allows you to shorten
391360	395520	turn 8, as you will already be as far to the inside as you possibly can be without getting
395520	396520	penalised.
396520	399800	That's with all of these tiny margins for track limits, you may want to give yourself
399800	402960	a bit more leeway in the race to avoid picking up penalties.
402960	407120	This just hopefully shows you what can be done and what is allowed to be done if you really
407120	408720	need to on a push lap.
408720	412160	Let the steering wind off as you run to the left on the exit of 8.
412160	416400	Stick to the white line, and get ready to, once again, haul yourself over the curb for
416400	418360	the braking zone into turn 9.
418360	423080	Just before the 50m mark, jump on the brakes and instantly begin heading for the apex, shifting
423080	424080	down to third.
424080	428480	Again, trail braking is key, it's all about balancing your steering input with your
428480	432680	brake pressure to maintain the perfect level of grip needed to make the corner.
432680	436760	You're aiming for your front right wheel to be all the way onto the stripy curve, in fact
436760	440640	on this occasion, get it even further onto the blue netted section.
440640	444440	Get back on the throttle as you reach your apex, and if everything's gone perfectly, you
444440	448080	should naturally run out beyond the stripy curve, and even the teeth.
448080	453320	So long as, you guessed it, you keep contact with the stripy curve, with your inside tires.
453320	456920	I was as close as you can possibly get to the limit on this particular lap.
456920	460560	If there was an equivalent to go line technology or hawk eye, the crowds would probably be
460560	461560	gasping.
461560	465480	Unlike previous examples where you kept the car all the way over here, on this occasion,
465480	468840	you're going to need to pull the car back to the right immediately, to avoid bottoming
468840	470720	out as you break for turn 10.
470720	474400	So long as you're right on the far left edge of the teeth, you should be okay.
474400	479480	Get on the brakes hard, just as the additional Austrian flag runoff area ends on the left.
479480	483760	Stay in third, and quickly make your way to the inside, easing off the brake as you aim
483760	485480	for the stripy inside curve.
485480	490040	As always, avoid the yellow hump on the inside, as this is likely to throw your car out white,
490040	494000	and get back on the power as soon as you feel the car drop over the apex curve.
494000	497280	This is such a satisfying corner when you get it right, it feels like the curve hooks
497280	499160	you in and pulls you around.
499160	503320	It just makes it fast and rewarding, allowing you to carry great speed all the way out over
503320	506400	the curve on the outside as you power towards the finish.
506400	509920	Track limits here are the same as everywhere else, keep contact with the stripy curve and
509920	510920	you should be fine.
510920	514880	A slight difference here however, is that if you are as wide as you're allowed to be,
514880	518840	you might end up bottoming out a bit and losing both speed and stability, so I really wouldn't
518840	523760	recommend allowing your left front to drift over the high left edge of those teeth.
523760	527920	But that's it, you've completed a fast lap of the red bull ring, so now let's see how
527920	529040	it all flows together.
593320	623280	So there's your lap, a circuit of fine margins, you really do need to push
623280	627360	the boundaries here to find that last second, but as I keep banging on about, if you at
627360	630920	least know where those limits are on a hot lap, you'll be able to better judge just
630920	634040	how much liberty can be taken during a regular race.
634040	638600	I can guarantee you that by simply getting closer to the edges than you were previously,
638600	641880	you will gain free lap time, regardless of nailing the other bits.
641880	643880	So what about lap time targets then?
643880	649400	This lap was a 127.58, but the pros would be looking at high 26s in these sorts of hot
649400	654480	lapping conditions with even more aggressive setups and mid-lap TC and bias adjustments.
654480	659040	If you're getting up to speed as an am, then anything below a 134 is a decent lap time,
659040	662760	whereas those of you looking to compete online should be looking around about the 1 minute
662760	663760	30 mark.
663760	667640	As always, these times are simply set as targets to try and motivate you, please don't
667640	670080	be disheartened if you aren't there yet.
670080	675160	Track conditions, setup, fuel levels all play a huge role in affecting lap time, and I certainly
675160	679160	wouldn't be looking to drop below 28s regularly if I was in a normal session.
679160	682680	The main thing is that you were able to learn something from this video to help you go
682680	684680	faster around the circuit.
684680	687360	Right then, anyone for a 10 second summary?
687360	690320	Eat your turn one from a wide-line wide-ex at wide-line, 3 wide-ex at wide-lines, 4 use
690320	693000	the curb unlike me wide-ex at wide-line as 6 trail brake watch rovers to your wide-line
693000	695600	to 7 brush your teeth shock at 8 full eating sign wide-ex at brush your teeth, hang on
695600	698320	through 10 full power wide-ex at brush your teeth again.
