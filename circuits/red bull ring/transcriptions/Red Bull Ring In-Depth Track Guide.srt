00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hey guys, it's Yogi here and welcome to the channel for episode 24 of the in-depth

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
track guide series for a setter course of competition.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
In today's episode we'll be taking a look at the Red Bull Ring which came with the GT2

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
DLC pack.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,040
We'll be breaking down each individual corner giving you all the knowledge and tips that

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,000
you need in order to help improve your lap times.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,040
If you want to see the other in-depth track guide episodes make sure to check out the

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,120
don't miss out on future episodes.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,920
The Red Bull Ring could be found in the stereo and mountains of Austria and has a circuit

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,360
length of 2.68 miles which equates to 4.32 km.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,920
The track features 10 corners with a medium to hide down for setup and soft to medium suspension.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,120
Your key overtaking spots are going to be turns 1, turn 3, turn 4 and turn 6.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,680
The pit entry can be found after the second to last turn on the right hand side of the

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
circuit.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,720
You will need to break slightly on the pit entry slip road in order to make that right

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,240
handle on the inside of the pit entry barrier and then again slow down just before you get

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,920
to the gantry in order to make it to the pit speed limiter line at the appropriate speed.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,440
The pit exit line is just after the traffic lights at the end of the pit lane disengaged

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,360
limiter here accelerate out the pit lane and once again you'll need to slow for the right

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,560
handle on the inside of turn 1 here in order to avoid clipping the wall and damaging the

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
car.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,320
Make sure you stay to the right of the pit exit merge line as you then accelerate up

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,040
towards turns 2 and 3.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,720
The braking zone for turn 1 starts at the 100 meter board however some cars may allow

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,120
you to brake marginally later than this.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,600
You want to be straddling this curb on the left hand side as much as you possibly can to

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,120
open up that first turn getting hard on the brake shifting the car down into second gear.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,360
Our apex is going to be mid way through the corner brushing our inside right hand

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,320
wheels on the red and white curbing that is here at the apex.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
It's absolutely crucial that you avoid the yellow sausage curb there on the inside because

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,000
it will bounce unsaturated the car and completely ruin your exit.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Get the car straight end up and get hard on the power as soon as you possibly can because

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,040
getting a good run off of this corner is going to be absolutely crucial leading onto

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,240
the longest straight on the circuit.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
Providing you keep two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing you should remain

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,480
within track limits so don't be afraid to go over and straddle that yellow sausage

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,120
curbing that is there on the outside in the dry conditions it's not going to unsettle

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
the car too much and it's going to allow you to carry a higher apex speed in the wet

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,160
conditions however you want to be staying off of this curbing in order to avoid losing

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
any traction.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,480
Turn 2 is barely a corner that we even need to worry about so we're now into the braking

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,760
zone for turn 3.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,640
Despite the higher speeds we can still brake at 100m board and make the corner due to

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
the uphill slope on the approach to the corner.

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,440
Try and straddle as much of the curve as you possibly can on the left hand side of the

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,480
track here in order to open up the turn, shift the car all the way down into first gear

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,360
and aim to hook up a mid to late apex.

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,440
You don't necessarily need to touch the curve here on the inside you just want to be getting

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,640
as close to it as possible and focus on straightening up the car for the exit.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
You once again want to be avoiding that yellow such as curb that's there on the inside

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,160
of the corner and you want to be picking up the throttle just before you actually reach

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
this apex point.

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Focus on trying to keep the car straight as possible and managing that traction don't

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,280
be afraid to use the curbing here on the outside once again making sure that you keep at

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,760
least two wheels on the red and white curbing in order to stay within track limits.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,640
As this is a crucial traction zone in the wet conditions you'll be wanting to avoid

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,200
the curbing entirely.

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Full turn 4 will once again be braking at the 100m board and will be getting as far

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,880
left as we possibly can, strolling that red and white curbing that's there on the outside

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,760
on the approach to the corner.

62
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Turn in reasonably late with a nice flowing arc through the turn and hook up a mid to late

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
apex.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,120
You're going to be in either first or second gear depending on your car's gear ratios.

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,960
So slight bit of camber here, the curbing is flat here on the inside so make sure to

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,920
get your right hand wheels up over that curbing in the dry conditions however do take caution

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,600
with it in the wet as you start to pick up throttle and continue through the turn it may

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,360
cause oversteer whilst up on that curb.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,600
Before the exit we again want to be managing the power and getting a good translation

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,080
of traction as we drive off of the corner, we've got just beyond the red and white serrated

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,960
curbing a blue painted tarmac strip with gravel beyond it.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,480
Use the curb and that bit of tarmac in the dry conditions of see avoid dipping your wheels

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,400
into the gravel as that will hurt your momentum off the turn and then in the wet conditions

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,960
you want to stay clear of both in order to give yourself the best drive off the turn you

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,360
possibly can.

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,640
Turn 5 is effectively a continuation of the turn 4 exit so we're now into the braking

77
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,120
zone of turn 6.

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,480
Place the car as far right as you possibly can over the red and white serrated curbing

79
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,400
on the right hand side of the track here break at a 50 meter board and immediately start

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,000
going in the car in towards the inside of the corner.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,600
We're going to be looking to apex midway through the turn in second or third gear depending

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,640
on the car's gear ratios, it's a smooth flat curb with some grass creep there on the

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,760
inside feel free to use this in the dry conditions and progressively pick up the throttle do take

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,160
caution with it in the wet as it may cause some oversteer.

85
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,480
From the outside of the corner we've got a serrated curve with blue painted tarmac and

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,880
gravel beyond it make sure to use this available runoff towards you providing you don't dip

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
the wheels into the gravel track limits is not going to be an issue you're going to be

88
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,360
running into the gravel and hurting your momentum before you breach those but as always

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,320
stay clear of the painted tarmac and that red and white curbing on the exit in those

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,440
wetter rainy conditions.

91
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,760
Keep the car as far right over the curbing and that painted tarmac strip as you possibly

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,000
can and then just as the gravel ends on the approach to turn 7 that is when we're going

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
to get onto the brakes is going to be a short gentle squeeze on those brakes as we once

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,800
again guide the car into a mid corner apex will be in second or third gear depending on

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,640
the car's gear ratios curbing is exactly the same as it was on the previous corner smooth

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,080
flat with some grass creep there on the inside get your left wheels up on this as much as

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
you can in the dry conditions however do take caution with it in the wet.

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,440
Feed the power in fairly aggressively and let the car go way out onto the curbing on the

99
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,040
exit of turn 7 here which immediately feeds into turn 8 the two are pretty much connected

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
together.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,240
Keep the left wheels of the car on that red and white serrated curbing in order to avoid

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,160
reaching track limits and keep the right hand of wheels out of the gravel.

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,560
In the wet and rainy conditions you'll be wanted to stay clear of this curbing entirely.

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,120
Coming into turn 9 the penultimate corner we once again want to be putting our car

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,400
as far over the left hand side as we possibly can over that red and white curbing break

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,240
out the 50 meter board and immediately start turning the car in shifting the car down

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
into third gear and hooking up a mid corner apex.

108
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,720
Get the inside tyres up over the curbing and on the grass creep on the inside do this

109
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,400
in both the dry and wet conditions.

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,040
Try to be confident on the exit get punchy with the throttle and let the car run out

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,760
wide making use of that runoff area.

112
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,440
Make sure that you keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,960
within track limits and in the wetter and more slippery conditions be cautious running

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,760
out wide over this curbing here probably avoid it entirely.

115
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,240
From the approach to the final corner you'll still be on that exit curbing bring the

116
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,120
car back so the left hand wheels are on it not the entire car because once you get to

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,480
the breaking point at the end of the red and white painted tarmac runoff area the floor

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,880
and spitter of the car will bottom out on that serrated curbing so make sure it's just

119
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,680
your wheels that are on it drop the car down into second gear and make sure you apex

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,920
make corner.

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,320
Unlike previous corners at this circuit you should be able to hammer that inside yellow

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,680
sausage curve and you should be able to do this in both the dry and wet conditions.

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Hard on the throttle as soon as we hit out apex let the car run out wide and make use

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
of the available runoff to you.

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,240
Keep at least two wheels on the red and white serrated curbing to stay within track limits

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,200
and for the wetter conditions you'll want to stay away from the curbing entirely.

127
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,760
With the breakdown of each corner complete let's go ahead and piece it all together with

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:38,760
a demonstration lap.

129
00:08:38,760 --> 00:09:03,960
With this go complete I just want to highlight down in description below are my track titan

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:27,560
affiliate links.

131
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,160
If you do pick up track titan make sure to compare yourself against my lap that is here

132
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,720
in the guide just search for yorki065 in the community tab of the reference lap time.

133
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
I hope both that and this guide have been useful to you leave a like if so let us know
